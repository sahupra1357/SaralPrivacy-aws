    excerpt:
      "The DPDPA mandates that every consent request must be accompanied by a clear, standalone notice. Generic 'I agree to T&Cs' checkboxes are no longer sufficient. Here is what Indian businesses must implement.",
    editorNote:
      "Editor's note: This briefing was originally published before the DPDP Rules, 2025 were notified. It has been reviewed and updated in March 2026 to reflect the notified Rules and phased implementation.",
    whyItMatters:
      "Your consent notice is the first place many businesses will fail DPDPA in practice. If your form does not clearly explain what data you collect, why you collect it, and what the person is agreeing to, your consent process is already weak. This briefing explains what your forms must say from day one. Most Indian business websites currently bundle consent into Terms and Conditions, which the DPDPA explicitly prohibits. If your sign-up form, enquiry form, or checkout page uses pre-checked boxes or bundled consent language, you are operating outside the framework of the Act. Rectifying this during the phased implementation window is significantly easier than retrofitting it under active regulatory scrutiny.",
    summary:
      "Under Section 5(1) of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, every request for consent must be accompanied or preceded by a 'notice' from the Data Fiduciary to the Data Principal. This notice must be itemised, clear, and in plain language. It must specify exactly what data is being collected, the purpose for which it is being processed, how the individual can exercise their rights, and how they can complain to the Data Protection Board. Crucially, under Section 6(1) consent must be free, specific, informed, unconditional, and unambiguous — meaning each distinct purpose requires a separate consent signal. You cannot combine marketing consent with transaction processing consent in the same checkbox.",
    businessImpact:
      "Businesses collecting personal data through websites, apps, or offline forms must redesign their consent flows. This affects customer acquisition, CRM onboarding, newsletter subscriptions, lead generation forms, and employee data collection. Penalties for non-compliant consent or notice fall under the Schedule's residual category — breach of any other provision of the Act — and can reach up to ₹50 crore (Schedule Item 7).",

    excerpt:
      "Every resume stored in your ATS or shared folder is personal data under DPDPA. Recruitment agencies handling candidate profiles for multiple clients face layered obligations they may not be aware of.",
    whyItMatters:
      "Recruitment agencies routinely collect, store, and share sensitive candidate data — resumes, identity documents, salary expectations, reference contacts — across multiple clients and platforms. Many of these practices were unregulated. DPDPA changes that fundamentally. Agencies that process personal data as part of their core business model are Data Fiduciaries with significant obligations.",
    summary:
      "A recruitment agency sits at the intersection of multiple data flows: candidate personal data, client confidential requirements, background check documents, reference information, and in some cases, sensitive financial or medical data. Under DPDPA, collecting a resume constitutes collection of personal data. Sharing that resume with a client without specific consent from the candidate could constitute a violation. Retaining rejected candidate data beyond a reasonable period without notice is also a compliance gap. Agencies using third-party ATS platforms must ensure those vendors qualify as Data Processors under compliant agreements.",
    businessImpact:
      "Agencies must implement candidate consent flows at the point of CV submission. Data sharing with clients must be disclosed in the consent notice. Retention policies for rejected candidates must be defined and communicated. Third-party ATS vendors must sign Data Processing Agreements.",

    excerpt:
      "Chartered Accountant firms handle some of the most sensitive personal data in India — PAN, Aadhaar, bank account details, payroll records, and tax filings. DPDPA treats this as regulated personal data with specific handling obligations.",
    whyItMatters:
      "CA firms have traditionally relied on client relationships and professional confidentiality as their primary data governance framework. DPDPA creates a parallel statutory layer with enforceable obligations. Firms that process payroll for clients are acting as Data Processors. Firms that manage their own employee data are Data Fiduciaries. Both roles create compliance obligations that must be addressed proactively.",
    summary:
      "Under DPDPA, processing personal data for tax filings, audits, payroll, or advisory services requires a lawful basis. Where the client is a company, the firm processes personal data of third-party individuals (employees, directors, shareholders). This creates obligations around notice, purpose limitation, and retention. Aadhaar data is particularly sensitive — its use is already governed by the Aadhaar Act, and DPDPA adds further requirements. Bank account numbers, salary slips, and investment records are personal data that must be handled with access controls, encryption, and documented retention schedules.",
    businessImpact:
      "Firms must audit their client data flows and identify where personal data of individuals (not just companies) is processed. Shared drives, email attachments, and cloud accounting tools are all vectors for personal data that need governance. Staff must be trained on data handling. Retention and deletion schedules must be documented.",

    excerpt:
      "If your D2C brand sends promotional messages via WhatsApp, SMS, or email, you need to verify that your consent collection is DPDPA-compliant. Implied consent from a past purchase is no longer a reliable basis for marketing.",
    whyItMatters:
      "India's D2C ecosystem is heavily reliant on WhatsApp marketing, SMS retargeting, and email flows. Most brands use a customer's purchase history as implied permission to market to them. DPDPA's consent framework challenges this. Going forward, marketing communications require specific, informed consent that is separate from transactional consent.",
    summary:
      "A customer placing an order on your website gives consent for order fulfilment — shipping updates, payment confirmations, return processing. That consent does not automatically extend to promotional messages, loyalty programme nudges, or retargeting campaigns. Under DPDPA, each of these purposes requires separate consent. Brands using Meta's WhatsApp Business API, for example, must ensure their opt-in flows meet DPDPA requirements in addition to Meta's own policies. Brands using third-party analytics tools (Meta Pixel, Google Analytics, Clevertap, WebEngage) that process personal data must also disclose this in their Privacy Notice.",
    businessImpact:
      "D2C brands will need to redesign their checkout flows to separate transactional and marketing consent. Existing customer databases may need re-consent campaigns. Marketing automation workflows must include consent verification before sending. Third-party tool disclosures must be added to Privacy Notices.",

    whyItMatters:
      "Many Indian businesses have no formal incident response plan. A ransomware attack, leaked database, or accidental email disclosure that exposes customer or employee personal data triggers mandatory notification obligations under DPDPA. Failing to notify can result in penalties up to ₹200 crore. More importantly, delayed or mishandled breach communication dramatically erodes customer trust.",
    summary:
      "Section 8(6) of DPDPA requires every Data Fiduciary to notify the Data Protection Board (DPB) and each affected Data Principal of a personal data breach 'in such form and manner as may be prescribed'. The DPDP Rules, 2025 require a two-stage notification: an initial report within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach, followed by a detailed investigation report. Each affected Data Principal must also be informed — the Act sets no risk threshold or de minimis exception for this. Businesses should now build basic incident response capabilities: detection, containment, assessment, notification, and remediation. Reviewed: March 2026.",

SDFs must: appoint a Data Protection Officer; conduct periodic Data Protection Impact Assessments; carry out periodic audits; and comply with algorithmic transparency requirements.
