/**
 * The header information architecture, as data.
 *
 * It lives apart from Header.tsx so the route contract can be reviewed — and
 * tested — without reading the rendering. Every `href` here is asserted to
 * exist by `lib/data/navigation.test.ts`; a typo'd path fails the suite rather
 * than shipping a 404 into the chrome.
 *
 * ── Why menus carry groups, not a flat list
 *
 * The previous model was `featured` plus a flat `items: NavItem[]`, with a
 * `columns: 2 | 3` hint for the grid. That gave every panel the same structural
 * treatment regardless of what was in it, and the result was skewed four ways:
 *
 *   Readiness   3 items in a 2-col grid — one empty cell, ragged bottom-right
 *   Tools       3 items in a 2-col grid — the same empty cell
 *   Industries  12 items, no descriptions, gap-y-1 — a dense wall
 *   Resources   6 items mixing four different kinds with nothing to say so
 *
 * Density ran backwards: the panel with the most items was the only one with
 * no descriptions, so the fullest menu read as the tightest. And the four
 * triggers looked identical in weight while the payload behind them varied 4x.
 *
 * Groups fix the cause rather than the symptom. A group is a column with a
 * heading that names the reader's intent, so twelve sectors become four
 * scannable triads and Resources stops asking the reader to infer that a hub,
 * a feed and a lookup are different kinds of thing.
 *
 * ── Which four menus, and why not the old four
 *
 * "Readiness" and "Tools" claimed to split on "where do I stand?" versus "help
 * me do the work", but the line did not hold: the penalty calculator is a tool
 * that answers where you stand, the compliance checklist is work, and data
 * discovery tells you where you stand. Three of six items sat on the wrong
 * side, and the split bought two half-empty panels for a distinction the
 * content did not honour.
 *
 * They are now one menu whose groups follow the actual sequence of the work —
 * Assess, then Map, then Act. The scent words the split was protecting survive
 * as group headings, which is where they were doing the work anyway.
 *
 * The slot that freed went to Insights. Resources was carrying two different
 * relationships to time: reference a reader consults when a question comes up
 * (the Act, the Rules, the glossary, the FAQ) and a feed they return to
 * because it changed (briefings, the blog). Someone coming back for today's
 * briefing should not have to open a menu named for looking things up.
 *
 *   Compliance  what do I have to do, and what do I do it with
 *   Industries  show me my sector
 *   Insights    what is new, and what is being said about us
 *   Resources   help me understand it, and answer my question
 *
 * ── On the destinations that appear here and in lib/learnNav.ts
 *
 * /penalty-calculator, /glossary and /compliance-checklist are each reachable
 * from this bar AND listed as topics in learnNav's 17-entry reading order.
 * That is deliberate, not drift: the header is wayfinding ("what can I do
 * here?"), learnNav is a reading order through the Act ("what comes next?").
 * The same page legitimately holds a place in both. What was wrong before was
 * that neither file said so. Those three entries in learnNav carry an explicit
 * `href` precisely because they leave /learn/[topic]; that flag is the seam,
 * and it is documented on both sides now.
 *
 * ── Why every item carries a description
 *
 * "Data flow maps" and "Data discovery" are indistinguishable as bare labels;
 * the reader cannot tell which one finds data and which one charts it without
 * clicking one and going back. A one-line description is the difference
 * between a menu that answers the question and a menu that defers it.
 *
 * The sector grid is the one exception, and it opts out wholesale rather than
 * half-describing itself: twelve descriptions would turn the panel into a
 * page, and the sector labels are self-evident in a way that "Data flow" is
 * not. The all-or-none rule is asserted per menu in the test suite.
