/**
 * briefing-taxonomy.ts — single source of truth for the /briefings discovery facets.

 * Three facets, all stored on EXISTING Appwrite attributes (collection is at attribute
 * capacity — no new fields):
 *   - Stage   → stored in `category`          (learn | assess | fix | sustain)
 *   - Sector  → stored in `industries[0]`     (slug, e.g. "schools-colleges")
 *   - Format  → stored in `tags[0]`           (slug, e.g. "checklist")
 *
 * The pipeline writes the SLUGS via tools/briefing_taxonomy.py (Python mirror — keep the
 * two in sync). Labels live here and are resolved client-side. Unknown slugs fall back to
 * the raw value, so a drift never hard-breaks the page.
