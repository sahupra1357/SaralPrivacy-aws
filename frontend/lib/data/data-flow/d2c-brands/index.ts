// D2C Brands Personal Data Flow pack - assembled config.
// Spec: docs/SaralPrivacy_D2CBrands_DataFlow_Spec.md.
// Same presentation framework as recruitment, CA and training institutes; only
// content differs.
//
// THREE operating models (own website / marketplace-first / omnichannel) are
// genuine, different data journeys - not cosmetic filters. Own website is the
// default; marketplace-first renders a leaner picture built on platform-owned
// systems; omnichannel renders the full union plus retail and unified-profile
// surfaces that neither of the other two has.
