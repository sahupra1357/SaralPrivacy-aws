/**
 * briefings-archive.ts — one fetch + one normalise for every briefings surface.
 *
 * `/briefings` and `/briefings/all` both need the whole archive, and before this
 * they would each have run their own paginated loop and their own field
 * unpacking. Two copies of the unpacking is how the two pages start disagreeing
 * about what a briefing is.
 *
 * Everything below comes out of fields the pipeline already writes. The three
 * facets ride on existing Appwrite attributes (see briefing-taxonomy.ts), and the
 * verdict, the infographic headline and the week theme all live inside the
 * `why_it_matters` JSON envelope — the same envelope the detail page parses.
 * Topic slugs are derived here, server-side, so the client receives ten short
 * strings instead of 240 briefings' worth of body text.
