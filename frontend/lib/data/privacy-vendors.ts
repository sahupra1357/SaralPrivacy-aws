// Single source of truth for the Data Fiduciary / DPO identity and the sub-processor
// list published in the Privacy Notice. Read by app/privacy, app/rights, and Footer.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  RULE: a row belongs here ONLY if the vendor actually receives a data
//  principal's PERSONAL DATA. "We have the dep installed" is not the test —
//  "does our users' personal data reach them" is. If a PR adds such a processor,
//  it adds the row in the SAME PR; if one stops being used, the row goes. An
//  inaccurate sub-processor list is the exact failure our own assessments penalise,
//  and over-disclosure (listing vendors that DON'T get personal data) is just as
//  inaccurate as under-disclosure.
//
//  Deliberately NOT listed, and why:
//   • Anthropic  — used to DRAFT briefings/blog content (app/api/briefings/generate,
//                  blog/validate, blog/revise). Only our own editorial text is sent;
//                  no subscriber/lead/assessment data. Covered by a plain-language
//                  AI note in the notice instead of a sub-processor row.
//   • Svix       — NOT a processor. `svix` is used once, in app/api/webhooks/resend
//                  to VERIFY the signature of incoming Resend webhooks. We send it
//                  nothing; it is Resend's sub-processor, not ours.
//   • Twilio     — dep installed but unused (no live WhatsApp send). Add the row in
//                  the PR that ships WhatsApp delivery.
//   • KIE / Nano-Banana — offline infographic build script (tools/), no personal data.
