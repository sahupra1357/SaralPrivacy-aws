// Hero "is-this-me" verdicts — one per sector, keyed by Sector.assessmentSlug.
// Powers the interactive hero (Beat 1): pick a business type → instant read.
//
// IMPORTANT: `band` and the specifics are ILLUSTRATIVE starters drafted from
// sector knowledge — they are NOT the user's real score. The hero copy always
// frames them as "typical" and points to the real assessment for the actual
// score. Verify/refine against each pack before treating as authoritative.
//
// Hero tap #2 (HERO_TAP2_SPEC.md): a row may carry one sector-true yes/no. The
// question is a real pack question — `pre` names the pack option a "Yes"
// pre-selects in the assessment (`?pre=<questionId>:<optionId>&src=hero`).
// This file holds STRUCTURE ONLY: the question, answer lines and clauses are
// visitor copy and live in messages/en.json under home.heroQuestions.<slug>.
// Band movement is AUTHORED, never computed: one answer through the engine is
// meaningless (normalised by Σcaps). yesBand is one step up (capped at High),
// noBand one step down (floored at Moderate), and the two must differ.
