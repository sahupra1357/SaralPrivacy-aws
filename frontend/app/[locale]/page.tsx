// only refreshes when someone happens to deploy is one that goes stale in
// public: the homepage would say 22 Aug while /briefings, one click away,
// showed the 25th. Same window as the source page, so the two cannot disagree

// Homepage — ten sections, three chapters. See LANDING_PAGE_SIGNOFF_SPEC.md.
//
// ── The rhythm system ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The page had twelve sections and two navy bands, both at the ends, with ten
// consecutive cloud-50 sections in between. It read as one flat wash, because
// white on cloud-50 is 1.05:1 — real, and invisible.
//
// Measured across the ramp: cloud-100 1.12:1, cloud-200 1.28:1, cloud-300
// 1.59:1, navy-700 17.31:1. So there IS range here; the page just wasn't
// spending it. cloud-200 is the useful step — 1.28:1 is exactly the ratio the
// Surface ladder already trusts as a card hairline, and area discrimination is
// an easier perceptual task than the small-text legibility WCAG ratios are
// calibrated for.
//
// Three jobs, three mechanisms:
//   FILL      marks the group     navy = chapter · white ↔ deep = sub-group
//   PADDING   marks the beat      statement 32 · demo 24 · utility 20 ·
//                                 evidence/decision 16 · rail 10
//   HAIRLINE  marks the boundary  between two beats that share a fill
//
// Sections that share a fill do so because they are one thought — the demo pair
// (S3+S4), the process/sector pair (S6+S7), the reference pair (S8+S9). Flipping
// every section is the zebra W1.3 killed, just louder.
//
// `scripts/design-lint.sh` enforces it: two adjacent light sections may not
// share a padding type. Section.tsx got zero adoption the first time precisely
// because nothing checked it.

// ── Where the recognition band went ──────────────────────────────────────────
// A navy "who's behind this" band used to sit between the report and the three
// steps. Founder call (2026-08-22): that question belongs on /about, where a
// visitor who asks it has already gone looking. Its four "how we work" pillars
// moved there with it; the founder card and press strip were already on that
// page, which is what made the homepage copy a second source of truth for one
// person's CV.
//
// Removing it cost the page its mid-page dark reset, so the architecture
// rebalanced rather than just closing the gap: the briefings deck (S7) takes
// navy and becomes Authority Moment 2. The page now reads dark-open (S1–S3),
// light-middle (S4–S6, the product and the fit), dark-turn (S7), quiet close
// (S8–S9) into the dark CTA — symmetric, and one fewer beat.
