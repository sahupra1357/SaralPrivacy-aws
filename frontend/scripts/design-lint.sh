# Core Theme v4.0 drift gate. Run from webapp/: bash scripts/design-lint.sh
#
# A ratchet, not a pass/fail wall. Two of these rules describe debt that
# predates the theme (roughly a hundred hand-rolled green-500 CTAs, a handful
# of oversized card radii); Waves 1-3 burn them down surface by surface. So the
# gate records the count it inherited and fails only when a count goes UP —
# new drift is blocked from day one, and the baseline drops as waves land.
#
#   bash scripts/design-lint.sh            check against the baseline
#   bash scripts/design-lint.sh --update   re-record after a wave lands
#
# Written for bash 3.2 (macOS default): no associative arrays.
