// S9 — the objection FAQ, and the last thing before the close.
//
// It used to render faqs.slice(0, 5) — "What is the DPDPA?", "What counts as
// personal data?" — which is a fine reference set and the wrong job here. A
// visitor this far down has decided DPDPA matters; what stops them clicking is
// how long it takes, whether we want their email, whether we keep their
// answers, and whether the result is worth anything. Those are the questions.
//
// The full library still lives at /faq. See `homepageFaqIds`.
//
// Presented as hairline rows, not cards. Eight bordered cards stacked with 12px
// gaps is eight objects for one list — the deep fill was already separating the
// section, so each card's own hairline was drawing a box the reader has to
// parse before reading the question inside it. Rules between rows do the whole
// job with one line each, which is how a printed Q&A has always set this, and
// it buys back ~90px in the bargain.

// The homepage FAQ slice arrives already localized, in display order, from the
// server page (spec §4.3 bundle law); `total` is the full /faq library size.
