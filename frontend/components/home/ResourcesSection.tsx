// It replaces two full sections — a seven-card briefings deck and a nine-row
// guide table of contents — that together ran past 2,500px doing what 400px
// does. The archives are not lost, they are on their own pages, which is where
// someone browsing an archive actually wants to be.
//
// The counts live here rather than under the hero. "130+ briefings" and "17

// will you email me".

 * image asset: a cover mock at 2× would be ~40KB of LCP-adjacent weight for a
