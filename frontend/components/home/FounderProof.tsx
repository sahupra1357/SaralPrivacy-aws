// it matches the About page's card system. Brand tokens via Tailwind.

// One source for one person's CV. The homepage's navy recognition band used to
// import these; that band is gone (founder call, 2026-08-22 — "who's behind
// this" is an About-page question), so this is now the only place either string
// is stated, which is the arrangement they should have had from the start.
