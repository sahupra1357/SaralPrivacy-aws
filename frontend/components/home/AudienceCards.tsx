// S7 — "Your sector", as a cover-flow deck. Founder-directed design
// (2026-08-22, from a sketch): the briefings deck's layered-card feel, but
// arranged as a centred stage — the selected sector's card in full, its
// neighbours peeking from behind at ±1 and ±2, everything past that hidden.
//
// The sketch alone can't carry twelve: a pure carousel means a visitor whose
// sector is card nine paddles through eight clicks to find themselves, and
// twelve stacked layers collapse into slivers ("crash 4 layers" — exactly
// right). So the deck gets a RAIL OF ALL TWELVE CHIPS above it: findability
// in one glance, then the chosen card animates to centre. Drama and
// findability, not a trade.
//
// Motion rules: transforms and opacity only (GPU-cheap, no layout thrash),
// one deal-in when the section first scrolls into view, 500ms recentre on
// select, and prefers-reduced-motion collapses all of it to instant swaps.
//
// Every card is server-rendered with its real links (guide, assessment, flow
// map where live) — off-centre cards are `inert`, which keeps them out of the
// tab order and away from screen readers while leaving the HTML fully
// crawlable. Internal-linking budget: 12 guide + 12 assessment + live map
// hrefs, more than the old name row carried.
