/**
 * Per-card link into a sector's live data-flow map (AudienceCards).
 * Client component only so the click fires flow_crosslink_click — the markup
 * still server-renders, so the link stays in crawlable HTML.
 *
 * The caller owns ALL of the appearance through `className` — shape as well as
 * colour, since the sector cards went dark and these became outline chips. This
 * component holds the destination, the label and the event; nothing else.
