# SaralPrivacy — Real Estate & Property Firms Personal Data Flow Map (Map #8)

**Status:** ✅ **LIVE on production 2026-08-02** (`main` `41cbac5`), signed off on preview by Dilip.
Both gating decisions are SETTLED (§0) — do not re-open them. 68/68 tests green; flags = counter = 8
in all three models. **Eight maps now live.**
**Route:** `/industries/real-estate/data-flow`
**Contract:** `docs/SaralPrivacy_DataFlow_Framework_Spec.md`
**Handoff:** `handoff.md` at the project root — §0–§6, §8–§9 are current; §7 and §11 are law-firms
history.
**Precedents:** Law firms (multi-model, gated spine, derived hotspot count, tight language locks) ·
Schools (first gated spine with a non-superset default) · D2C (the generalised multi-model rule)

---

## 0. The two gating decisions — ⛔ SETTLED 2026-08-02

| Decision | Dilip's call |
|---|---|
| The pasted spec's architecture | **Content-only pack.** Mine its content inventory in full; reject its bespoke architecture in writing (§8). No component, schema or route edits. |
| Gate 0 — operating models | **Three, model-gated spine 10 / 13 / 14** — `brokerage` (default) · `developer` · `property-management`. No superset model. |

### Decision 1 — the pasted specification's architecture

The pasted specification is internally split. Its §2 and §26 say exactly what the framework says —
*"Reuse the shared data-flow engine"*, *"Do not create an isolated real-estate-only framework"*,
*"Use one shared component engine"* — while its §14–§26 then enumerate a bespoke Real-Estate-only
engine: ~35 `RealEstate*` components, a parallel `RealEstateFlowSystem` / `RealEstateFlowStage` /
`RealEstateFlowNode` / `RealEstateFlowEdge` type system, a 19-counter `RealEstateFlowMetrics`
module, a 16-event `real_estate_flow_*` analytics namespace, 22 graph filters and 8 view modes.

**Resolved in favour of its own §2 and §26: content-only pack.** The spec's content inventory is
excellent — its stage, system, control-break and hotspot detail is the richest sector input since
the clinics spec, and it is mined in full below. Its architecture is rejected in writing in §8, one
row per deviation, nothing silently dropped.

### Decision 2 — Gate 0: three operating models

Three, as specified: `brokerage` (default) · `developer` · `property-management`. They differ in
*process*, not merely in scale (§2), so the stage spine is **model-gated** — the recruitment /
clinics / schools / law-firms precedent.

**No superset model.** A fourth `integrated` model was proposed and declined. It was raised because
the handoff's gating convention assumes a superset exists ("each gated entity tags itself with its
own model **+ the superset**"), and none of these three contains the other two. **That assumption
was checked against the engine and is a convention, not a constraint** — the word *superset* appears
nowhere in `lib/data-flow/schemas.ts`, and `validatePack`'s only model rule is that an edge's
`businessModels` be a subset of both endpoints'. Three models validate cleanly. The only cost is
that no single view shows all seventeen stages, which is a display nicety, not a defect.

---

## 1. The sector's shape

Recruitment is a pipeline that flows once. A CA firm is a loop that recurs yearly. A training
institute is a lifecycle with an end. D2C is a funnel that never closes. A clinic is a record that
outlives the visit. Education is a permanent record accumulated by proxy. A law firm is an
adversarial record that becomes public by design.

**Real estate is a deal that ends and a database that doesn't — circulating in a network the client
never chose.** Three things are true here that are true nowhere else in the series:

1. **The lead is the asset, not the by-product.** A broker's actual stock-in-trade is the old
   buyer/tenant database. Every other sector in this series retains data by inertia; here it is
   retained *because it has resale value*. The purpose ends at registration; the record is kept
   precisely because another deal might come out of it. That inverts the usual retention
   conversation — "we forgot to delete it" becomes "deleting it destroys the asset".
2. **Onward sharing is the workflow, not the leak.** A client's phone number, budget and household
   details are *meant* to travel — to co-brokers, channel partners, builders, landlords, societies,
   loan agents. A law firm shares with an adversary; a property firm broadcasts to competitors and
   partners simultaneously, in a WhatsApp group, in seconds. Neither the firm nor the client can
   enumerate who now holds it.
3. **In rentals the data describes a home, not a transaction.** Who lives there, who visits, when
   they are out, who has the keys, who cleans. Held and continuously added to by societies, gate
   systems, security vendors and maintenance contractors — parties the tenant never contracted with
   and the property manager does not control.

**Signature exposure (hotspot #1): the client's number, budget and family details posted into a
co-broker or channel-partner WhatsApp group.** Unrecallable, un-enumerable, and it is how the deal
gets done. It is this sector's equivalent of the school publishing a child's face — the moment
control ends, performed deliberately, as routine business.

---

## 2. Operating models

| id | Label | Stages | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `brokerage` | Brokerage & property consultancy | 10 | **DEFAULT** (drives the `/data-mapping` card stats) |
| `developer` | Developer / builder sales | 13 | — |
| `property-management` | Rental & property management | 14 | — |

`?model=` values are exactly these ids, so the spec's requested `?model=brokerage`,
`?model=developer` and `?model=property-management` all work as written. `brokerage` is first
because it is what most Indian brokers, consultants and small agencies searching this actually run.

### Why this is a process split, not a scale split

- A **brokerage** matches a client to somebody else's property, circulates the requirement through a
  co-broker network, coordinates a site visit, negotiates, supports KYC and a loan referral, and
  takes a commission at registration. It never runs a construction payment schedule and never holds
  a deposit.
- A **developer sales org** runs campaigns into a call centre, books and allots a unit, then carries
  the buyer for years — demand notices linked to construction, possession and defect lists, key
  handover, and a transfer of resident data to the RWA and facility vendors. Its channel partners
  are contracted, attributed and paid; its "co-broker group" is a partner portal.
- A **property manager** takes a landlord mandate over somebody's home, screens a tenant through
  police verification and employer checks, then holds an *ongoing* relationship: rent, maintenance
  vendors entering the property, keys and access credentials, society and gate systems, an exit
  inspection and a deposit deduction.

### Stage spine — union order

Nine of the seventeen stages are **all-model**; eight are gated.

| seq | id | Name | Models |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `landlord-mandate` | Landlord mandate & property onboarding | `property-management` |
| 2 | `enquiry` | Lead capture & first enquiry | all |
| 3 | `qualification` | Qualification, budget & household profiling | all |
| 4 | `matching` | Property matching & broker-network sharing | all |
| 5 | `site-visit` | Site visits, walk-ins & field coordination | all |
| 6 | `negotiation` | Offer, booking & terms | all |
| 7 | `kyc-documents` | KYC, identity & property documents | all |
| 8 | `screening` | Tenant screening & police verification | `property-management` |
| 9 | `finance` | Loan, lender & payment coordination | `brokerage`, `developer` |
| 10 | `agreement` | Agreement, stamp duty & registration | all |
| 11 | `construction` | Construction updates, demand notices & payments | `developer` |
| 12 | `possession` | Possession, handover & defect management | `developer` |
| 13 | `tenancy` | Move-in, rent collection & maintenance access | `property-management` |
| 14 | `society` | Society, facility & resident handover | `developer`, `property-management` |
| 15 | `exit` | Renewal, exit inspection & deposit settlement | `property-management` |
| 16 | `commission` | Commission, referral & post-deal reuse | all |
| 17 | `archive` | Old leads, closed deals, archives & deletion | all |

- **brokerage** sees 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 16, 17 = **10** — exactly the spec's §9 journey
- **developer** sees 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17 = **13**
- **property-management** sees 1–8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 = **14**

### Why the counts are not 10 / 10 / 10

The spec asks for ten stages per variant, and each of its three journeys genuinely enumerates ten.
Those three tens assume **three independent stage arrays**, which is the bespoke architecture
rejected in Decision 1. The shared engine has **one** `stages` array filtered by `businessModels`,
so per-model counts are *derived from the union* — they cannot be set independently.

**Brokerage lands on exactly 10**, matching the spec's §9 journey one-for-one. The other two exceed
ten only because the union already contains stages they share with brokerage (`matching`, `finance`,
`commission`) that their own §10 / §11 journeys fold into neighbouring steps. Nothing is added that
the spec does not describe; the same content is simply distributed across the shared spine. This is
also what the framework requires: *"Do not force equal stage counts to look tidy."*

**Gating convention:** the shared core carries **no** `businessModels` tag; each gated entity tags
itself with exactly the models that run it.

---

## 3. The hotspot count is DERIVED, not chosen

Guard test (a) — `hotspots reconcile with the counter in every model of every pack` — makes the
recurring flags-vs-counter defect unshippable. The construction it requires: **every hotspot node
ungated, and its earliest stage a distinct all-model stage.**

Nine stages are all-model. Eight of them carry a hotspot:

| Stage (seq) | Hotspot node | Rank | The failure in one line | Bucket |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `matching` (4) | `co-broker-group` | **1** | The client's number, budget and family details go to a network nobody can list or recall | `broker_network_sharing` |
| `kyc-documents` (7) | `kyc-document-folder` | 2 | PAN, Aadhaar, bank statements and title papers arrive over WhatsApp and land in personal folders | `kyc_property_document` |
| `archive` (17) | `old-lead-database` | 3 | Nothing expires, because the old-lead database *is* the firm's asset | `retention_incident_readiness` |
| `qualification` (3) | `sales-crm` | 4 | Income guesses, household notes and subjective comments, visible to everyone and exportable by anyone | `crm_staff_vendor_access` |
| `enquiry` (2) | `shared-lead-sheet` | 5 | The lead is on a spreadsheet and a personal phone before anyone has been told anything | `client_lead_data` |
| `site-visit` (5) | `field-exec-phone` | 6 | The client's number and live location handed to site security, builders and landlords; photos and routes kept | `client_lead_data` |
| `agreement` (10) | `documentation-vendor` | 7 | The full KYC set to every intermediary — drafter, notary, registration agent, witness | `kyc_property_document` |
| `commission` (16) | `marketing-reuse-platform` | 8 | Closed *and* failed clients pushed into ad audiences and referral lists, with no withdrawal that propagates | `client_lead_data` |

⇒ **flags = 8 = counter in all three models, by arithmetic.**

All five assessment buckets are reachable from the hotspot rail ✅ — required by guard test (b).

`negotiation` (6) is all-model but carries no hotspot — that is fine and expected (schools ran 8
hotspots across 11 all-model stages). A hotspot node **may span later stages** — the CRM genuinely
does — but must never acquire an *earlier* one, which would move its flag in some models and break
reconciliation.

### The spec's 10 + 11 + 10 hotspots, and why this is 8

The spec asks for ten brokerage, eleven developer and ten property-management hotspots. The schema
caps hotspots at **5–8, pack-level and unfiltered** — the counter and legend print
`pack.hotspots.length`, so a per-model hotspot set would make the counter lie in every view but one.
The 31 proposed hotspots are not dropped: **eight become the red-flag rail above**, and the rest are
authored as **critical- and high-risk nodes** with their own `riskWhy` / `riskAction`, which render
in full in the journey, the node drawer and the table view. They simply do not carry a red flag.

The gated-stage ones — necessarily node-level, because a gated flag would make the counter lie in
the models that hide the stage:

- the **lender file** — bank statements and salary slips at four loan agents, rejected applications
  never returned (`finance`) — *spec brokerage #7, developer #6*
- the **police-verification and screening vendor** — tenant, household *and* domestic-staff identity
  pushed into a police workflow and a private screening vendor (`screening`) — *spec PM #4*
- the **society app, gate register and CCTV** — continuous occupancy, visitor and vehicle recording,
  entirely outside the firm's control (`society`) — *spec PM #8, developer #10*
- the **maintenance vendor with home-access instructions** — a contractor gets a name, an address, a
  phone number and how to get in (`tenancy`) — *spec PM #7*
- the **possession photo and defect repository**, and the resident dataset handed to facility
  vendors at handover (`possession`) — *spec developer #9*
- the **demand-notice and reminder trail** that exposes a buyer's outstanding balance to the sales
  team (`construction`) — *spec developer #8*
- the **exit inspection photos and deposit-deduction record** that become a lasting tenant-risk
  label (`exit`) — *spec PM #9*
- the **landlord bank and ownership document set** copied into management, finance and operations
  (`landlord-mandate`) — *spec PM #1*

The all-model ones folded into a neighbouring hotspot rather than duplicated: *spec brokerage #5*
(negotiation strategy forwarded) sits on the CRM hotspot's node copy; *spec developer #1*
(duplicate leads across campaigns, portals and channel partners) and *#4* (applicant, co-applicant
and nominee copied across booking systems) sit on the lead-sheet and KYC hotspots.

## 4. Content model

### Computed reference model

**Verified from the built pack**, not targets. Every published metric is computed by
`computePackSummary` / `filterByBusinessModel` — none is hand-typed into copy.

| | brokerage | developer | property-management |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stages | 10 | 13 | 14 |
| Distinct places (systems) | 37 | 49 | 47 |
| External parties | 23 | 30 | 29 |
| External transfers | 57 | 74 | 77 |
| Copies created | 84 | 111 | 112 |
| Hotspots (flags = counter) | 8 = 8 ✅ | 8 = 8 ✅ | 8 = 8 ✅ |

Pack totals: **17 stages · 68 nodes · 154 edges · 16 data categories · 16 personas · 8 hotspots ·
8 rights scenarios · 8 incident scenarios.** Comparable to law firms (16/69/179).

The pasted spec's own per-variant targets (≈28 / 34 / 30 distinct locations, ≈14 / 16 / 15 external
parties) sit just under these — the union spine gives each model a few more places than a
standalone dataset would, which is the same trade already accepted on maps #5–#7.

### Data categories — 16

Sixteen, not the spec's 43. Past ~16 the legend stops communicating and every node renders a wall of
tags; the fine distinctions live in each category's `examples`. Every one of the spec's 43 ids is
covered by one of these sixteen.

| id | Covers | kind |
|---|---|---|
| `client-identity` | Name, mobile, email, address, authorised representative, NRI/overseas contact | provided |
| `client-kyc` | PAN, Aadhaar, passport/OCI/visa, address proof | provided |
| `household-occupancy` | Family size, occupants, children, pets, domestic staff, lifestyle notes | provided |
| `employment-income` | Employer, occupation, salary slips, income and business proof | provided |
| `financial-records` | Bank statements, loan applications, sanction/rejection, payment history, deposits | provided |
| `requirement-budget` | Budget band, buy/rent preference, locality, unit preference, timeline | provided |
| `property-ownership-docs` | Title deeds, prior sale deed, tax receipts, society NOC, ownership records | provided |
| `transaction-documents` | Agreement to sell, sale deed, allotment, booking form, rent agreement, stamp & registration record | provided |
| `site-visit-location` | Visit history, route, attendance, gate entry, visit photos, live-location shares | provided |
| `occupancy-access` | Keys, access credentials, entry/exit logs, vehicle, visitor and delivery records, CCTV | provided |
| `maintenance-complaint` | Work orders, contractor visits, repair photos, complaints, inspection and damage records | provided |
| `communication-records` | WhatsApp threads, call recordings, email, SMS, reminder history, sales notes | provided |
| `third-party-records` | Co-applicant, nominee, guarantor, references, prior landlord, witnesses, domestic staff, other occupants | provided |
| `client-scoring` | Lead score, affordability and seriousness ratings, tenant suitability, payment-behaviour label, fraud flag | derived |
| `marketing-profile` | Campaign attribution, ad audiences, retargeting and referral lists, suppression state | derived |
| `staff-access-record` | CRM logins, exports, device sync, portal credentials, access logs | provided |

`third-party-records` and `occupancy-access` do the sector's distinctive work: the first shows how
much of the file belongs to people who never engaged the firm (a co-applicant, a guarantor, a
tenant's cleaner); the second is the rental half's signature — data that describes a home rather
than a transaction. `client-scoring` and `marketing-profile` are marked `derived`: the quiet half a
property firm never counts as personal data at all.

The spec's high-impact list (PAN/Aadhaar, passport/NRI, bank statements, income and loan documents,
title papers, sale deeds, rent agreements, family and occupancy data, home address, repeated
site-location data, police verification, access-key records, affordability scores, fraud labels,
children's household data) is carried through node `riskLevel` and the hotspot rail rather than as a
separate `impactLevel` field — the engine already renders risk that way, on every map.

### Named software — the "that's my firm" test

Generic "CRM" fails it. Name what the sector actually runs: **portal dashboards** (99acres,
MagicBricks, Housing.com, NoBroker), **Meta and Google lead-ad forms**, the **sales CRM**
(Sell.Do, LeadSquared, Zoho), the **Google Sheet lead tracker**, the salesperson's **personal
WhatsApp** and the **co-broker WhatsApp group**, the **channel-partner portal**, the **dialler and
call recording**, the **site-office visitor register and CCTV**, the **sample-flat appointment
book**, the **inventory and booking system**, the **home-loan desk and DSA/loan-agent files**,
**e-stamping, e-signature and the sub-registrar appointment portal**, the **society app**
(MyGate/NoBrokerHood/ADDA), the **gate register and domestic-staff register**, the **key register
and facility-management system**, the **maintenance work-order app**, the **rent-collection platform
and landlord statement**, the **police tenant-verification portal**, and the **physical file
cupboard** in the office.

---

## 5. Language locks

- **"High-impact identity, financial and property data"**, never "sensitive personal data" — the
  DPDPA creates no such statutory category. The spec makes this point itself; hold it.
- **No property, title, tax, registration, lending or investment advice.** This map describes custody
  and control of personal data. It does not opine on RERA, stamp duty, title validity, tenancy law
  or what a firm must retain under any of them.
- **Authority-controlled records must be marked as such.** A registered sale deed at the
  sub-registrar and a completed police verification are not the firm's to delete, and the map must
  say so plainly rather than implying a clean erasure path.
- **Retention is not uniformly deletable.** Commission and tax records, a registered instrument and
  an executed agreement have genuine grounds to be kept. Separate **what must be kept** from **what
  merely has been kept** — the old-lead database is the second, and that is the whole point of
  hotspot #3. (The spec states the same rule: *"Do not imply that all transaction records should
  always be erased immediately."*)
- **No accusation, no fearmongering.** Broker networks and channel partners are how this industry
  works; the map's job is to show where control breaks, not to tell a broker their trade is a
  violation. Watch the high/critical ratio — if most of the map is red, none of it is.
- **Distinguish the occupant from the signatory.** A co-applicant, a nominee, a guarantor, a
  tenant's family member and a domestic worker are separate people with separate rights. Never
  collapse them into "the client". (Spec validation rule 33.)

---

## 6. The two walkthrough sections

Mandatory build step (handoff §4 Step E), and the shared engine's answer to the spec's §22 client-
rights simulator and §23 incident simulator. Copy `lib/data/data-flow/ca-firms/scenarios.ts` for the
language-lock header shape. Every referenced node must be visible in every model where the scenario
shows.

### Rights scenarios — 8

Covering all nine request types the spec's §22 lists.

| id | The request, in their words | Type | Models | Spec §22 option |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `rs-who-has-my-number` | "Four brokers I never contacted called me. Where did they get my number?" | access | all | Show me my personal data |
| `rs-delete-my-old-enquiry` | "I enquired two years ago and never bought. Delete everything." | erasure | all | Delete an unsuccessful lead |
| `rs-stop-calling-me` | "Stop calling me about new projects. The deal closed." | withdraw-marketing | all | Stop promotional communication |
| `rs-delete-my-kyc-after-registration` | "It's registered. Delete my PAN, Aadhaar and bank statements." | erasure | all | Delete documents after a closed transaction |
| `rs-correct-my-details` | "My address and my co-applicant's name are wrong on the record." | correction | all | Correct contact details / KYC / ownership |
| `rs-change-who-speaks-for-me` | "My father held the power of attorney. Deal with me directly now." | authorisation-change | all | Change an authorised representative |
| `rs-my-file-went-to-five-lenders` | "My salary slips went to lenders I never chose. Get them back." | complaint | `brokerage`, `developer` | Raise a privacy complaint |
| `rs-i-moved-out-a-year-ago` | "Why does the society app still list my visitors and my cleaner?" | erasure | `property-management` | Delete after the relationship ends |

*"Correct my property preference"* is folded into `rs-correct-my-details` rather than given its own
walkthrough — the propagation path is identical and a separate card would repeat it verbatim.

**`blockedNodeIds` is the honest half**, and it carries unusual weight here. Three things a real firm
genuinely cannot reach, and the walkthroughs must say so:

- the **registered instrument at the sub-registrar** — an authority-controlled public record
- **co-brokers' and channel partners' own phones and CRMs** — the network that makes
  `rs-who-has-my-number` mostly a *partial* answer, which is exactly the lesson
- the **society, RWA and gate system** after handover — the property manager is not the controller
  there, and `rs-i-moved-out-a-year-ago` must not pretend otherwise

### Incident scenarios — 8

The spec's §23 lists ten; two are folded (co-broker contacts the client without authority → the
`inc-lead-sheet-open-link` and hotspot #1 node copy; property-management vendor exposes access
records → `inc-tenant-kyc-in-society-group` plus the maintenance-vendor node).

| id | Title | Severity | Models |
|---|---|---|---|
| `inc-id-to-wrong-whatsapp` | A PAN and Aadhaar copy went to the wrong WhatsApp contact | critical | all |
| `inc-lead-sheet-open-link` | The shared lead sheet is open to anyone with the link | critical | all |
| `inc-ex-staff-crm-export` | A departed salesperson kept a CRM export | high | all |
| `inc-bank-statement-to-lenders` | A client's bank statement was forwarded to loan agents they never chose | high | `brokerage`, `developer` |
| `inc-wrong-agreement-draft` | The wrong client's draft agreement was sent out | high | all |
| `inc-site-register-photographed` | A site-visit register page was photographed and circulated | medium | all |
| `inc-tenant-kyc-in-society-group` | A tenant's KYC was posted into a society WhatsApp group | critical | `property-management` |
| `inc-lost-field-phone` | A field executive's phone holding client documents was lost | high | all |

Labelled an **operational response reference**, explicitly not breach-notification advice — the
shared `IncidentSimulator` already carries that framing, matching the spec's own instruction.

## 7. Verified inputs (checked against source, 2026-08-02)

| Field | Value | Verified against |
|---|---|---|
| Sector slug | `real-estate` | `lib/data/sectors.ts:43` |
| `navLabel` | Real Estate & Property Firms | `sectors.ts` |
| `assessmentLabel` | Real Estate & Property | `sectors.ts` |
| `reportType` | `realty` (6 chars — under the Appwrite `string(10)` cap) | `sectors.ts` |
| `assessmentRoute` | `/assessment/real-estate` | route exists, 200 on prod |
| Assessment client | `app/assessment/real-estate/RealEstateAssessmentClient.tsx` | exists |
| Industry page | `app/industries/real-estate/page.tsx` — **exists**, 254 lines, 5 FAQs | 200 on prod |
| `discoveryNicheId` | **`re-brokers`** ("Real estate brokers & agents") | `lib/discovery/data.generated.ts` |
| `lexicon` | `subject: "client"` · `subjectArtefact: "One client's property file"` · `org: "firm"` | reads correctly in "outside your firm" for all three models |

Other real discovery slugs, deliberately not chosen: `re-developers`, `property-management`,
`commercial-re`, `rental-platforms`, `housing-societies`, `coliving-pg`. `re-brokers` matches the
default model; the map is not niche-switched per model.

**`assessmentBuckets`** — verified against `lib/data/industry-assessment/packs/real-estate.ts`:

```
client_lead_data
kyc_property_document
broker_network_sharing
crm_staff_vendor_access
retention_incident_readiness
```

All five are reachable from the hotspot rail (§3) and all five must appear in the assessment
client's `BUCKET_FOCUS`, or guard test (b) fails.

### ⚠️ Assessment-client work is required and test-enforced

| Check | State |
|---|---|
| `<Suspense>` on `app/assessment/real-estate/page.tsx` | ❌ **MISSING — must be added, or `next build` fails** |
| `useSearchParams` in `RealEstateAssessmentClient.tsx` | ❌ **not present — must be added** |

Copy `app/assessment/schools-colleges/page.tsx` and its client's `?bucket=` + `BUCKET_FOCUS` + teal
focus-banner pattern. This is the one place `useSearchParams` is correct — the assessment is
`noindex`. The data-flow client is the opposite case and must never use it (handoff §6).

### `boundaryLabels`

The spec's 35-value relationship taxonomy maps onto the engine's seven boundaries:

| Boundary | Label | Absorbs from the spec's taxonomy |
|---|---|---|
| `candidate` | The client | buyer, tenant, seller, landlord, co-applicant, occupant, authorised-representative |
| `agency` | Your firm | internal, salesperson, field-executive, branch |
| `client` | Builders, landlords & owners | builder, developer, property-owner, society |
| `vendor` | Portals, CRM & service vendors | vendor, subprocessor, property-portal, marketing-agency, facility-manager, security-vendor, maintenance-vendor, title-search-vendor |
| `government` | Registration, police & authorities | government-authority, police-verification, notary, registration-agent |
| `third-party` | Brokers, lenders & others who receive it | broker, co-broker, channel-partner, bank, nbfc, loan-agent, lawyer, courier, other-third-party |
| `public` | Open links & public records | — (open share links, the registered instrument) |

`third-party` is unusually load-bearing here — the broker network is the sector's signature and it is
neither a vendor (nothing is processed on the firm's instructions) nor a client.

### Presentation copy

The spec's §4 headline, supporting copy, central question and both disclaimers, and its §33 SEO
block, are adopted **as written** — they are good and they match the series' voice.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| H1 | One client. One property decision. Many systems and people. |
| `metaTitle` | Real Estate Client & Property Data Flow Map \| SaralPrivacy |
| `metaDescription` | See how buyer, tenant, seller and landlord data moves through property portals, brokers, site visits, KYC, loans, agreements, registration and archives. |
| `ogTitle` | Where does one real-estate client's data go? |
| Central question | If this client asks you to locate, correct or delete their data, can you find every copy held by your staff, brokers, builders, lenders and vendors? |

## 8. §14 — What this build deliberately does NOT do

The spec's §14–§26 propose a bespoke Real-Estate-only engine, contradicting its own §2 and §26. Per
the established response (maps #3–#7) and Decision 1, its **content inventory is mined in full** and
its **architecture is rejected in writing**. Every deviation is recorded here rather than silently
dropped.

| Spec asked for | Not built | Why |
|---|---|---|
| ~35 new `RealEstate*` components (§26: `RealEstateFlowPage`, `RealEstateVariantSelector`, `RealEstateStageCard`, `DocumentLocationMatrix`, …) | ❌ | Violates the spec's own §26 ("use one shared component engine") and the presentation-unified law. The shared engine already renders all of it pack-driven. A parallel tree means maps #9–#12 diverge from #1–#8. |
| `RealEstateFlowSystem` / `RealEstateFlowStage` / `RealEstateFlowNode` / `RealEstateFlowEdge` parallel types (§14, §15, §19) | ❌ | The existing `FlowNode` / `FlowStage` / `FlowEdge` schemas carry every field that renders. A second type system forks validation, both guard tests and the 7 per-pack tests. |
| 43 data categories (§8) | ❌ — **16 authored** | Past ~16 the legend stops communicating. All 43 ids are covered; fine distinctions live as `examples`. |
| 35-value `RealEstateRelationshipType` taxonomy (§13) | ❌ — **mapped to 7 boundaries** | The 7 boundaries answer the question that changes the fix: inside the firm, at a vendor, at an authority, at another party, or public. Full mapping in §7. |
| `RealEstateFlowMetrics` with 19 counters (§20) | ❌ | `computePackSummary` plus the journey's cumulative counters derive every metric that is *displayed*. Unrendered counters are not metrics. |
| `calculateRealEstateCumulativeMetrics` (§21) | ✅ **already exists** | The journey already prints new / reused / cumulative places and new external transfers per stage, for every map. |
| 22 graph filters (§25) | ⚠️ partial | Risk and connection-type filters exist, plus the accessible table view. A 22-facet filter bar on a reference model is a research tool, not a teaching one. |
| 8 view modes — recipient matrix, document-location matrix, data-category matrix, rights-coverage view, external-transfer table (§7.7, §25) | ❌ | More views of the same ~68 nodes. The lane board, the accessible table view and the node drawer answer the same questions three ways already. |
| "Ten stages per variant" (§35 rule 7, §40) | ❌ — **10 / 13 / 14** | One shared `stages` array filtered by model; per-model counts are derived from the union and cannot be set independently. Brokerage lands on exactly 10. Reasoning in §2. |
| 10 + 11 + 10 per-variant hotspots (§9.12, §10.12, §11.12) | ❌ — **8 pack-level** | The counter and legend print `pack.hotspots.length`, unfiltered, so a per-model set makes the counter lie in every view but one. The other 23 are authored as critical/high-risk nodes — full mapping in §3. |
| 16 `real_estate_flow_*` analytics events (§34) | ⚠️ partial | Reuse the shared `trackEvent.dataFlow` namespace. A per-sector event namespace makes cross-map comparison impossible — the exact thing the OMTM needs. |
| FAQ schema on the data-flow page (§33) | ❌ | There are no visible FAQs on this page, and the spec itself says "FAQ schema only for visible FAQs". (The *industry* page has 5 real FAQs and keeps its schema.) |
| Content path `src/content/data-flow/real-estate/` (§16) | ❌ | Repo convention is `lib/data/data-flow/real-estate/`. Same shape, existing path — the spec says "adapt to repository conventions". |
| Client-rights simulator + marketing-withdrawal + KYC-correction as three bespoke components (§22, §26) | ❌ — **rights scenarios** | The shared `RightsSimulator` says all three in the section Dilip rates highest, with no new component. All nine of §22's options are covered by the eight scenarios (§6). |
| Incident simulator as a bespoke component (§23, §26) | ❌ — **incident scenarios** | Shared `IncidentSimulator`, 8 scenarios covering §23's ten (§6). |
| `SpecialRealEstateRiskPanel` — NRI, joint buyers, children, police verification, … (§12, §26) | ⚠️ folded in | Delivered as node risk copy, data-category `examples` and scenarios rather than a tenth page section. |
| Component, interaction and E2E test suites (§36) | ⚠️ partial | The repo's harness is `node --test` over the datasets, plus two guard tests. Dataset integrity, cumulative counts, variant isolation, rights and incident coverage are all covered. No component/E2E runner exists to add these to; adding one is its own cycle, not this pack's. |
| Lighthouse 90+ / a11y 95+ / responsive at 7 widths, verified (§28, §29, §37) | ⏳ **not measured** | Never measured on any of the seven live maps. Flagged as an open item — **not claimed** (§9). |
| Inspect the supplied Vercel preview URL (§2, §38) | ⚠️ **substituted** | The URL given (`webapp-git-feat-data-flow-recruitm-…`) is a stale recruitment-branch preview and returns 302 — previews are SSO-gated. The **live production** `/industries/real-estate` page and the repository were inspected directly instead, as the spec's own preamble instructs. |
| Move the `/data-mapping` card to "Available maps" after approval (§31) | ✅ automatic | The single registry line does it, in the spec's recommended order (Real Estate 8th). It shows on the **preview** for review; production is unchanged until Dilip merges. |
| Variant label "3 operating models" on the card (§31) | ✅ automatic | The card already prints "N operating models · Shown for <first label>" from `businessModels`. |

**Also worth flagging:** the spec asks for `?model=` URL state (§7.3) and an accessible table
fallback (§7.7) as if they were new. **Both already exist** — added in the map #6 cycle and
inherited by every pack (`DataFlowClient.tsx`, `FlowSystemTable.tsx`). No work needed.

## 9. Known limitations — stated, not hidden

1. **Lighthouse, axe and responsive behaviour have never been measured on any map in this series.**
   The spec asks for 90+/95+/95+/95+ and 320–1440 verification. Do not begin claiming them here. A
   related measured defect is already on record: white on `green-500` is **2.54:1** against a 4.5:1
   bar, and that is the primary CTA on all seven live data-flow pages and would be on this one.
2. **Content not domain-reviewed.** Like every pack before it, the sector detail is authored from the
   framework, the assessment pack, the industry page and the pasted spec — **not** validated by a
   practising broker, developer sales head or property manager.
3. **No single view shows all seventeen stages**, because there is no superset model (§0). A reader
   who wants the whole union has to switch between three tabs.
4. **`society` is gated to `developer` + `property-management`.** A resale brokerage does deal with
   societies for NOCs and transfer formalities. That is carried as node-level risk copy on the
   documentation vendor rather than as a stage, to keep the three models genuinely distinct.
5. **The map does not model co-living / PG operators or housing societies as controllers**, though
   both are real discovery niches with their own exposure. They are adjacent sectors, not variants of
   this one.
6. **Flags-vs-counter debt elsewhere is untouched.** `training-institutes` still mismatches on 2 of 3
   models and remains in `KNOWN_HOTSPOT_DEBT`. This pack must not add to it — §3's construction plus
   guard test (a) is what prevents that.

## 10. Build order

1. **Author the pack** — `lib/data/data-flow/real-estate/` (8 files, schools-colleges shape).
   **Hotspot nodes first** (§3), then everything else around them.
2. **Register** — one line in `lib/data/data-flow/index.ts`, one in `lib/data-flow/data-flow.test.ts`.
   **Expect 68 tests** (61 today + 7 per-pack).
3. **Surface** — `<DataFlowPreview>` on `app/industries/real-estate/page.tsx`, above "How the
   3-minute scan works" (line ~173).
4. **Assessment deep-links** — `<Suspense>` + `useSearchParams` + all five buckets in `BUCKET_FOCUS`
   (§7). Test-enforced.
5. **Verify** — the test run, then the unenforced-constraint script from handoff §5 across **all three
   models**, requiring `flags=8 counter=8 OK` and no `!!` lines. Then `npm run build`.
6. **Preview → sign-off → prod.** Push, hand Dilip the branch alias, **stop**. Never self-merge.

Realistic cost: ~10–14h, ~85–90% of it writing content.
