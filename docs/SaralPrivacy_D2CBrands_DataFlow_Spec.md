# SaralPrivacy — D2C Brands Personal Data Flow Map

**Spec v1 · Map #4 in the Data Flow series · 2026-07-26**
Model copied: `docs/SaralPrivacy_TrainingInstitutes_DataFlow_Spec.md` (multi-model) · Contract: `docs/SaralPrivacy_DataFlow_Framework_Spec.md`
Actor: **Customer** · Route: `/industries/d2c-brands/data-flow`

## 0. The one decision that governs everything else

A long external "Claude Code development specification" was supplied for this map — the same
situation as map #3. It is an excellent **content inventory**: its stage, system, external-party
and hotspot detail is the best input this series has had, and we mine it in full. But its
**architecture is wrong for this codebase** and is not followed literally. It proposes a bespoke
three-variant engine: ~27 new components (§25), a new graph node/edge model (§19), a new metrics
interface (§20), a customer-rights simulator (§7.9), a filter/table-fallback matrix (§24), a new
validation module (§35), a new test suite (§36) and `d2c_flow_*` analytics (§34) — all scoped to
one industry.

That violates two settled laws:

- **"Presentation unified, content varies"** (architectural law): the data-flow *presentation* is
  identical across all 12 industries; only *content* differs. A view change shipped to one
  industry alone is forbidden.
- **The config-driven engine** (handoff §0): a map = **one pack folder + two one-line
  registrations**, ~content-only, no route/component/schema edits.

**And the pasted spec's headline feature already exists.** Its "three genuinely different
journeys, not cosmetic filters" is exactly what `businessModels` does today — recruitment ships
two, training institutes three, gated per-stage / per-node / per-edge and filtered by
`filterByBusinessModel()`, with the selector auto-hiding at one model.

> **Locked scope: Selective Expansion** (confirmed with Dilip before authoring). Deliver the
> pasted spec's rich content and its three operating models **through the existing config
> engine**. Author one pack; touch no route, schema or graph model. See §12 for the explicit
> "will NOT build" list and §13 for the shared-view fixes that were in scope.

## 1. The 10-layer standard applied to D2C brands

Identical presentation, D2C content.

| Layer | D2C content |
|---|---|
| Main actor | **Customer** (plus the **gift recipient**, a second principal who never dealt with the brand) |
| Business journey | 10 stages, ads → deletion |
| Personal data | 15 categories, 4 of them derived |
| Business activity | selling, fulfilling, supporting, and above all *marketing* |
| Systems | 44 nodes: storefront, marketplace, pixels, gateway, WMS, courier, helpdesk, CRM, CDP, ad platforms, archives |
| People who access | 12 personas, incl. the delivery agent and the marketplace account team |
| External sharing | payment, logistics, ad platforms, marketplaces, agencies, review platforms |
| Copies created | 40 / 35 / 61 copy events by model |
| Where control breaks | 8 hotspots |
| DPDPA expectation | per stage, in `dpdpaNote` |

**The sector's shape:** a **funnel that never closes.** Recruitment is a pipeline that flows once,
CA a loop that recurs yearly, a training institute a lifecycle with an end. A D2C customer buys
once and is marketed to for ever — which is why the map's centre of gravity is stages 9–10, not
checkout.

**Signature exposure (the thing no other vertical has):** *the customer list is the asset, and the
most routine thing done with it — uploading it to Meta and Google as a custom and lookalike
audience — is the transfer the customer was never told about and cannot escape by unsubscribing.*
Ranked hotspot #1.

---

## 2. Business models

Three genuine journeys, gated per node/edge. `omnichannel` appears in every gated tag, so it
renders the full union; `website` is the default and `marketplace` is honestly leaner.

| id | label | Gating convention |
|---|---|---|
| `website` | Own website brand | **default** — first declared |
| `marketplace` | Marketplace-first brand | platform-mediated, fewer own systems |
| `omnichannel` | Omnichannel brand | superset + retail/POS/CDP/clienteling |

- untagged → all three (shared core, 20 systems)
- `["website","omnichannel"]` → own-storefront surfaces (10)
- `["marketplace","omnichannel"]` → platform surfaces (6)
- `["omnichannel"]` → retail + unified-profile surfaces (4)

The stage spine is shared across models (as in TI): switching the selector **repopulates** the
journey, it never reshuffles it.

---

## 3. Lexicon & boundaries

`subject: customer` · `subjectArtefact: One customer's order` · `org: brand`.
`boundaryLabels`: candidate → "The customer", agency → "Your brand", **third-party → "Marketplaces
& platforms"**, public → "Publicly visible". A marketplace is modelled as `third-party` because it
is a separate controller the brand can read from but cannot administer or delete from — the
"responsibility boundary" the pasted spec asks to make visible (§10, §11).

---

## 4. Journey stages (10)

discovery · browsing · checkout · payment · fulfilment · delivery · support · returns · marketing ·
retention. Each carries a `summary` and a plain-English `dpdpaNote`.

---

## 5. Data categories (15)

Provided: identity, contact, address-delivery, order-transaction, payment-financial,
device-tracking, marketing-preference, support-grievance, returns-evidence, loyalty-rewards,
**gift-recipient-data**, **health-wellness**.
Derived: **browsing-behaviour**, **customer-profile**, **fraud-risk-flag**.

The pasted spec's `customisation` (§12.3) folds into `order-transaction` examples (engraving text,
uploaded design file); its children's-data edge case (§12.2) is out of scope for this sector's
reference model and is covered by the schools/training maps.

---

## 6. Hotspots — 8, ranked worst-first

| # | Node | Title | Bucket |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ad-audience-platforms` | Your customer list becomes an advertising audience | `tracking_adtech` |
| 2 | `consent-capture` | Marketing permission is bundled into the order | `marketing_consent` |
| 3 | `whatsapp-support` | Customer records scatter into personal WhatsApp | `customer_data_collection` |
| 4 | `order-export-sheet` | Order exports become a permanent second database | `vendor_fulfilment` |
| 5 | `courier-network` | Couriers and delivery agents keep name, number and address | `vendor_fulfilment` |
| 6 | `tracking-pixels` | Tracking starts before the visitor has any choice | `tracking_adtech` |
| 7 | `returns-evidence` | Return photos and risk labels build a second profile | `customer_data_collection` |
| 8 | `archive-backup` | Deleting the account does not reach the copies | `retention_preferences` |

All 5 assessment buckets are reachable. **All 8 nodes are ungated and land on 8 distinct primary
stages** (marketing, checkout, support, fulfilment, delivery, discovery, returns, retention), so
the journey's red flags equal the "places control breaks" counter — **8 = 8 in all three models**,
verified by script. This is the constraint the schema does not enforce (handoff §1) and that CA and
recruitment still fail.

The pasted spec asks for 9 / 8 / 10 hotspots per variant; the schema caps a pack at **8** and
hotspots are pack-level, not per-model. Deviation recorded in §12.

---

## 7. Sector edge cases carried into the content

| Pasted spec | How it ships |
|---|---|
| §12.1 health & wellness | `health-wellness` category on `recommendation-engine`, `store-clienteling`, `whatsapp-support`, `public-reviews-social`; framed as "high-impact health data", never GDPR-tier "sensitive" |
| §12.3 customised products | examples on `order-transaction` |
| §12.4 gift orders | `gift-recipient` **node + persona**, its own data category, and two edges — a principal who never saw a notice |
| §12.5 cash on delivery | `payment-financial` on the fulfilment/delivery chain + `fraud-screening` / `fraud-risk-flag` (RTO labels) |
| §10.10 marketplace → direct | `channel-migration` node, `critical`, with its own edges |
| §11.3 identity resolution | `cdp-identity-resolution`, `critical`, omnichannel-only |

---

## 8. Reference-model summary (computed, never hand-typed)

`computePackSummary()` / `filterByBusinessModel()`, per model:

| | website (default) | marketplace | omnichannel |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stages | 10 | 10 | 10 |
| Systems (places) | 31 | 27 | 41 |
| External parties | 18 | 15 | 23 |
| External transfers | 26 | 31 | 48 |
| Copy events | 40 | 35 | 61 |
| Critical-risk systems | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| High-risk systems | 18 | 12 | 21 |
| Unmanaged (shadow IT) | 4 | 4 | 4 |
| Control-break flags = counter | 8 = 8 | 8 = 8 | 8 = 8 |

Shape holds as the pasted spec intends — marketplace < website < omnichannel. Absolute counts run
above its "approximately" targets (§9.1, §10.1, §11.1), which it states are design guidance only
and to be computed from the dataset.

---

## 9. Presentation copy

`presentation` block carries the pasted spec's own headline and promise:
H1 **"One customer. Many systems. One brand's responsibility."**, its intro, its meta/OG strings,
its reference-model disclaimer, and three `howToRead` cards. Verbatim where the pasted spec's
wording was already right.

---

## 10. Wiring

1. `lib/data/data-flow/index.ts` — one line in `PACKS` (surfaces `/data-mapping`, footer, sitemap)
2. `lib/data-flow/data-flow.test.ts` — one line in `PACKS` (inherits 7 universal guarantees)
3. `app/industries/d2c-brands/page.tsx` — `<DataFlowPreview>` above "How the 3-minute scan works"
4. `app/assessment/d2c-brands/` — `BUCKET_FOCUS` + `<Suspense>` for the `?bucket=` deep link

Route, components, schema: untouched.

---

## 11. Files

New: `lib/data/data-flow/d2c-brands/{stages,data-categories,personas,nodes,edges,hotspots,index}.ts`
Modified: the four wiring points above, plus the shared-view fixes in §13.

---

## 12. Explicitly NOT building (rejecting the pasted spec's over-build)

| Pasted spec asks for | Verdict | Why |
|---|---|---|
| ~27 new UI components (§25) | ❌ | Shared components already render every pack |
| New graph node/edge model (§19) | ❌ | `flowNode`/`flowEdge` + BoundaryLaneMap already do this |
| Fresh variant selector + URL state (§7.3) | ❌ | `businessModels` + `filterByBusinessModel` exist and are tested |
| 13-metric panel (§20) | ❌ | `computePackSummary` + the journey counters already compute from data |
| Customer-rights simulator (§7.9, §22) | ❌ **backlog** | Genuinely new capability — belongs in the shared engine for all 12, not on one sector |
| 15-filter graph + table fallback (§24) | ❌ **backlog** | Same reason; today's risk filter + wire modes + lane board cover the need |
| Separate dataset per variant (§16) | ❌ | One pack; entities gated by `businessModels` |
| New validation module + test suite (§35–36) | ❌ | `validatePack` covers the listed checks; registration inherits the suite |
| `d2c_flow_*` analytics events (§34) | ❌ | Shared `trackEvent.dataFlow` events already fire with `industry`/`model`/`node_id` |
| 9 / 8 / 10 hotspots per variant (§9.12, §10.12, §11.12) | ⚠️ **8, pack-level** | Schema band is 5–8 and hotspots are pack-level; the 8 chosen hold in all three models |
| Tertiary "Generate your D2C privacy notice" CTA (§7.10) | ❌ | CTA band is shared; a per-sector third button would fork the view |
| Lighthouse / a11y / responsive targets (§27–28, §37) | ✅ inherited | Shared route already meets them; no new work |
| Rich content (stages, systems, external parties, hotspots, edge cases) | ✅ **use it** | This is the pasted spec's real value — mined into the pack |

**Net:** the pasted spec's *what* ships in full; its *how* is discarded because the codebase
already provides a better one.

---

## 13. Shared-view fixes made in this build (uniform, all 4 maps)

Three defects surfaced by adding a fourth map. Each is pack-driven, so every map gets the fix:

1. `DataFlowClient` hard-coded **"The seven places recruitment agencies most often lose track of
   candidate data"** — printed recruitment's words and a wrong count on CA, TI and D2C. Now
   `{pack.hotspots.length}` + `{pack.lexicon.subject}`.
2. `DataFlowClient` journey `aria-label` was hard-coded `"Candidate data journey"` → `pack.mainActor`.
3. `/data-mapping` card stats called `filterByBusinessModel(pack, "permanent")` — recruitment's
   model id — so **every other sector's card silently dropped its model-gated systems**. Now
   `pack.businessModels[0].id`. A "N operating models" chip and a "Shown for <default>" clause were
   added for packs with more than one journey, so the headline numbers read as the default model.

---

## 14. Known debt (not introduced here)

`ca-firms` and `recruitment-agencies` both still show **5 control-break flags against a counter of
7** — their hotspot nodes collide on shared primary stages (handoff §1). D2C reconciles at 8 = 8 in
all three models. Fix the older two when their content is next touched.

---

## Addendum — rights & incident walkthroughs (added 2026-08-02)

Third pack to author the two shared, opt-in sections, after `schools-colleges` and
`clinics-diagnostic-labs`. **Content only** — `scenarios.ts` plus two lines in `index.ts`. No
component, route or schema work.

**8 rights scenarios · 8 incident scenarios**, gated per model:

| Model | Rights shown | Incidents shown |
|---|---|---|
| `website` (default) | 7 | 6 |
| `marketplace` | 7 | 6 |
| `omnichannel` (superset) | 8 | 8 |

An own-website brand never sees the seller-portal walkthrough; a marketplace-first brand never sees
session replay; only omnichannel sees the store-clienteling incident.

### What makes these D2C-specific rather than generic

**The data subject often never transacted with you.** This is the difference from every other sector
in the series — elsewhere the person came to the business and knew it. Here a large share of the
record belongs to people who never bought anything:

- **`rs-gift-recipient`** — *"I never bought anything from you, why do you have my address?"* Someone
  else typed their name, address and phone into your checkout. There is no account to close and no
  consent to withdraw, yet they are in the database and usually already in a marketing audience.
  **No other map in the series has this right**, and the `gift-recipient` node is what makes it
  authorable.
- **`rs-stop-marketing`** — the sector's defining request. `blockedNodeIds` is blunt on purpose: a
  lookalike audience modelled from a list that included someone **cannot be un-seeded**, only stopped
  and rebuilt. Suppression is also routinely applied per-list rather than per-person, so the next
  export re-adds them.
- **`rs-who-holds-my-data`** — the marketplace controller question, and the honest answer that
  migrating marketplace buyers into brand marketing makes the brand a controller of data collected
  under someone else's notice.
- **`in-lookalike-upload`** is ranked the most severe incident, matching hotspot #1.

### Language locks

DPDPA scope only. No consumer-law, e-commerce-rules or payment-regulator claims, and no "sensitive
personal data" — the DPDPA creates no such statutory category. The incident section is labelled an
*operational response reference*; the shared component states that whether an incident must be
reported is the brand's decision with its own advisers.

### Verification

52/52 pack tests · `flags=8 counter=8` unchanged in all three models · **zero scenario references to
a node hidden in any model** · production build + TypeScript clean · eslint clean.

**Remaining without scenario content:** `recruitment-agencies`, `ca-firms`, `training-institutes`.
