# SaralPrivacy Personal Data Flow Map — Framework Spec & Build Playbook

**Status:** Recruitment shipped to production (main `4d0e8c4`, 2026-07-21). This is the
harmony contract for building maps #2..#12. Read it before starting any new industry.

**Supersedes for framework purposes:** the original build spec
(`SaralPrivacy_Recruitment_DataFlow_Spec.md` + v1.1 addendum), which remain the recruitment
*content* record. This document is the *engine + visual system + process* contract.

## 0. What this product is

The middle of the product spine: **Discovery** (what data do I hold) → **Data Flow Map**
(where does it go, who touches it, where does control break) → **Assessment** (how ready are
my controls) → **Notice Generator** (publish a compliant notice). One config pack per industry
drives it; the components are shared and industry-agnostic.

Route: `/industries/{slug}/data-flow`, indexed, in sitemap. Hub: `/data-mapping`.

## 1. Change inventory — what was built (so a new build knows the finished bar)

**Original build (Gates 0–5, ~9 commits):** schemas + recruitment domain pack → React Flow
graph + mobile journey → animated MotionJourney → collapsed the 4 business models to 2 →
DPDPA overlay → Gate-5 review. Shipped the *first* readable version.

**Refinement pass this session (11 commits) — the bar a new industry must clear:**

| # | Change | Why it matters to a new pack |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Places, not copy events** (`e396798`) | Headline = distinct places, counted once; per-stage counts reconcile with the boxes. Copy-events summed alternative routes and overstated. **Locked metric.** |
| 2 | **Connected to Discovery + the scan** (`1420bf0`) | The map gets inbound links from `/discovery` and the assessment result. |
| 3 | **Header nav `lg`→`xl`** (`bc021f9`) | Chrome fix; not pack-specific. |
| 4 | **`/data-mapping` landing + footer + registry** (`5244a7c`) | The registry (`lib/data/data-flow/index.ts`) makes surfacing a new map **one line**. |
| 5 | **Hotspot titles clickable + `whyItMatters` rendered** (`333add2`) | 7 hotspots must each carry a real `whyItMatters`; the title opens the node sheet. |
| 6 | **Boundary correctness** (`e86f358`) | Added `third-party` boundary; classify each node by who really controls it. |
| 7 | **Risk ≠ boundary colour** (`cba82c3`) | The locked two-axis colour system (below). |
| 8 | **"Moving here" data per stage** (`abb06ff`) | Journey names the personal data moving, new-at-stage emphasised. **The thing that makes it a *data* map.** |
| 9 | **Louder teal chips + sticky legend** (`94544e1`) | Data chips are teal, filled+pulse when new; legend lives in the sticky panel. |
| 10 | **Lane board replaces React Flow** (`128691f`) | The "full system map" is now boundary-rows × stage-columns with a control wall; `@xyflow/react` deleted. |
| 11 | **Risk filter + HOT legend** (`4d0e8c4`) | The full map has a worst-first risk filter (dim, not remove) and a HOT key. |

A finished industry map = all 11 present, by construction, because they live in shared
components. A new pack inherits them free.

## 2. Engine architecture (what you touch vs what you never touch)

```
lib/data-flow/                     ← ENGINE. Do not fork per industry.
  schemas.ts        Zod types, BOUNDARIES, RISK_LEVELS, ASSESSMENT_BUCKETS, validatePack,
                    filterByBusinessModel, computePackSummary
  stage-data.ts     stageDataRollup() — "what data moves per stage", shared by UI + tests
lib/data/data-flow/
  index.ts          REGISTRY. PACKS map + derived landing/footer/sitemap lists
  {slug}/           ← CONTENT PACK. One folder per industry (the only new files)
    stages · nodes · edges · personas · data-categories · hotspots · index
components/data-flow/               ← SHARED UI. Industry-agnostic. Do not fork.
  MotionJourney · BoundaryLaneMap · HotspotRail · NodeDetailPanel · EdgeDetailPanel
  DetailSheet · flow-theme
app/industries/{slug}/data-flow/    ← ROUTE. Thin clone: page.tsx + DataFlowClient.tsx
```

**Adding an industry touches exactly:** one pack folder, one registry line, one route clone
(2 files). Nothing in `lib/data-flow/` or `components/data-flow/` should change per industry —
if it must, that's an engine change and belongs in its own PR, reviewed as such.

---

## 3. Build playbook — 3 steps + 2 blockers

### Step 1 — Content pack (`lib/data/data-flow/{slug}/`)
Seven files, same shape as `recruitment/`. Export `{slug}DataFlowPack: DataFlowPack`.
Proven cloning method: Python str-replace transform on the recruitment folder — swap the
industry constant/fn names, slug strings, and content. Then rewrite content by hand; the
structure is the scaffold, not the substance.

### Step 2 — Register (one line)
Add to `PACKS` in `lib/data/data-flow/index.ts`:
`"ca-firms": caFirmsDataFlowPack`. This alone lights the `/data-mapping` card, footer row,
sitemap entry, and removes it from "Coming next". Sector labels come from `sectors.ts` — never
invent a name.

### Step 3 — Route clone (`app/industries/{slug}/data-flow/`)
Clone `page.tsx` + `DataFlowClient.tsx`. Change only: pack import, canonical URL, breadcrumb
labels, and the industry accent token (§5). Everything else is generic.

### ⚠️ Blocker A — `ASSESSMENT_BUCKETS` is recruitment-shaped
`schemas.ts` defines a **typed literal union** of 5 buckets
(`candidate_sourcing / candidate_document / client_sharing / ats_tool_access /
retention_rights`). Every hotspot's `assessmentBucket` must be one, or `tsc` fails. **But each
industry's assessment pack uses different bucket keys** — CA's are
`client_document / intake / storage_access / retention / vendor_incident`. Recruitment's
matching its own assessment was luck, not design.
**Fix before building pack #2:** generalise buckets to be per-pack — move the allowed set onto
the pack (`pack.assessmentBuckets`) and drop the shared literal, OR type it as `string` with a
per-pack `validatePack` check against that pack's assessment. Do **not** map a CA hotspot to
the nearest recruitment bucket — the deep-link would land on the wrong assessment section.

### ⚠️ Blocker B — the test file is single-pack
`lib/data-flow/data-flow.test.ts` imports `recruitmentDataFlowPack` directly and pins
recruitment specifics (externalParties === 15, LinkedIn === public). **Parametrise the
STRUCTURAL tests over the registry** (gate minimums, places-reconcile, boundary taxonomy,
stage-data invariants) and keep pack-SPECIFIC content assertions in a per-pack file.

---

## 4. Hard constraints (tsc / validatePack / gate tests enforce)

- **Exactly 7 hotspots** (`.length(7)`), ranks 1–7 unique, each with a non-empty
  `whyItMatters` (rendered — not filler).
- **Gate-2 minimums:** 12 stages, ≥28 nodes, ≥40 edges, ≥12 copy-creating edges, ≥10 external
  edges. Σcaps need not equal anything — normalised.
- **Referential integrity:** no dup ids; every referenced stage/category/persona/node id
  exists; edge `external` MUST equal "either endpoint ∈ EXTERNAL_BOUNDARIES" (derived — get
  boundaries right and it follows).
- **One person node** (`candidate`-equivalent). Person nodes are EXCLUDED from the places
  count. Everything else is `system / repository / device / physical_storage`.
- **Boundaries:** `candidate` + `agency` internal; `client / vendor / government / third-party
  / public` external. `third-party` = data shared with no processing contract (past employers,
  references); `public` = collected from genuinely open sources. A NEW boundary needs entries
  in `flow-theme.ts::BOUNDARY_META` **and** `BoundaryLaneMap.tsx::LANE_ORDER + LANE_SUB`
  (note: `map-builder.ts` was deleted with React Flow — lane order lives only in the lane map now).
- **Data categories** align to the industry's Discovery niche wording (there's a test for it).
  `kind: "derived"` = inferred, not provided (scores, risk ratings) — rendered "· inferred".

---

## 5. The colour system — locked semantics + per-industry accent

The map carries **three semantic axes that MUST stay identical across all 12 industries.**
They are the whole reason a user can read any map without a manual:

| Axis | Encoding | Hue — **reserved, never reused** |
|---|---|---|
| **Risk** | fill + icon | amber (high) / red (critical) |
| **Trust boundary** | left rule + label + glyph | **violet-500** (`#8e51ff`, 4.4:1 on white) |
| **Personal data** | chip (filled+pulse when new) | **teal** |

### The per-industry accent — where it lives, and where it must NOT
Each industry has a card accent on `/industries` (verified list below). Use it as the map's
**chrome** hue to create instant per-industry distinction — but **only in the decorative
layer**, never on the three semantic axes. This is the harmony rule:

**Accent OWNS (safe — decorative, per-industry):**
- Hero band + eyebrow
- Stage-tile gradients (`MotionJourney::TILE_GRADIENTS` — currently position-cycled decoration;
  make them accent-derived)
- Sticky score-panel gradient + the counter numerals' brand glow
- Primary CTA, stage number badges, the self-drawing underline

**Accent must NEVER touch (reserved — identical everywhere):**
- Risk fill (amber/red) · Boundary rule + pill (violet) · Data chips (teal) ·
  the HOT badge (red) · the control wall (violet)

**Why this matters:** if a law-firm map went violet-dominant, violet would mean both "law-firm
brand" AND "outside your agency" — the exact risk/boundary collision this session spent commits
removing. The accent lives in a fourth layer (chrome), semantics stay constant.

### The 12 accents (from `app/industries/page.tsx`, in `sectors.ts` order)

| # | Sector | Card accent | Collision risk with a semantic axis? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Recruitment | **teal / green** | ⚠️ teal = data axis. Ships as-is (recruitment reads as "SaralPrivacy default"); for #2+ prefer the accent to differ from teal so distinction is real. |
| 2 | **CA Firms** | **indigo** | ✅ clear of all three. Good first accent to prove the system. |
| 3 | Training Institutes | amber | ⚠️ amber = risk fill. Use a deeper/warmer amber for chrome, or shift to gold, so risk stays unambiguous. |
| 4 | D2C Brands | rose | ✅ clear |
| 5 | Clinics & Diagnostic Labs | cyan | ✅ (near teal — keep chrome cyan-600+, not teal-ish) |
| 6 | Schools & Colleges | sky | ✅ clear |
| 7 | Law Firms | violet | 🚫 **violet = boundary axis.** Do NOT use violet as chrome. Shift to indigo/plum for law's chrome, or accept a monochrome-navy chrome for law only. |
| 8 | Real Estate | emerald | ✅ (keep off teal-green) |
| 9 | Hotels & Travel | orange | ✅ clear |
| 10 | Pharmacies | purple | ⚠️ adjacent to violet — use a redder purple (fuchsia-leaning) for chrome so it reads distinct from the boundary rule. |
| 11 | Fintech / NBFC | blue | ✅ clear |
| 12 | Gyms, Salons & Spas | fuchsia | ✅ clear |

**Implementation:** add one `accent` field to the pack (or a small `INDUSTRY_ACCENT[slug]`
map), feeding: hero classes, `TILE_GRADIENTS`, the sticky-panel gradient stops, CTA colour.
The three semantic hues stay hardcoded in `flow-theme.ts` and the components — they take no
accent input. That separation IS the harmony guarantee.

---

## 6. Metric discipline (non-negotiable)
- Headline = distinct **places** (non-person nodes, once each, at first stage). Never "N copies
  of one X".
- Any number advertised off-map (teaser card, `/data-mapping`, landing) must be scoped to the
  model the map opens on, so **promise === arrival**.
- Every stage's box count must equal its `+N places` increment — locked by test.

---

## 6b. Authoring worksheet + content model (fill BEFORE any code)

Adopted from Dilip's industry playbook (2026-07-21). The engine gives you the *shape*; this is
the *content* discipline that keeps 12 industries in harmony. Every page answers seven
questions, and the pack is authored by filling this worksheet first, then translating to the TS
pack.

**The seven questions → page element**
| Question | Element |
|---|---|
| Whose data are we following? | The one person node (protagonist) |
| What business journey? | The 12 stages |
| What data is created/collected? | `dataCategoryIds` on nodes + edges → the "Moving here" chips |
| Where does it travel? | Systems/repositories (nodes) |
| Where does control weaken? | The 7 hotspots |
| What does DPDPA require? | `stage.dpdpaNote` (one operational duty per stage) |
| What next? | Hotspot fix + assessment CTA |

**Protagonist per industry** (the single `person` node):
CA firm → Client · Law → Client/matter subject · Clinic → Patient · School → Student ·
D2C → Customer · Real estate → Buyer/tenant · Hotel → Guest · Pharmacy → Patient ·
Fintech/NBFC → Borrower · Training → Student · Gym/Salon → Member.

**Stage-authoring method — start with the business lifecycle, NOT the apps:**
`Entry → Registration → Service delivery → Internal processing → External sharing → Closure →
Archive/deletion`. For each of the 12 stages, ask the five control-break questions — any "yes"
is a hotspot candidate: (1) does data create another copy? (2) does it leave the org? (3) is
the system unmanaged? (4) is retention unclear? (5) can the business find and delete it?

**DPDPA obligation library** (attach ONE to each stage — plain instruction, no section numbers):
Collect → *tell the person what you collect and why* · Consent → *keep evidence of what they
agreed to* · Use → *only for the stated purpose* · Share → *only what the recipient needs* ·
Vendor → *set clear responsibilities and limits* · Store → *managed, protected systems* ·
Retain → *no longer than needed* · Delete → *be able to find and erase copies* · Correct →
*allow inaccurate data to be fixed* · Breach → *know who acts and who must be informed*.

**Hotspot title rule:** name a visible operational failure, never a generic risk.
Good: *"Client documents remain in staff WhatsApp chats."* Weak: *"Poor data governance."*

### Hotspot taxonomy (NEW — additive field, adopt from the playbook)
Hotspots currently carry severity only. Add an **optional** `tags: HotspotTag[]` field so control
breaks are typed — this is the "kind" dimension the external review flagged as missing, and it
enables cross-industry filters/analytics later. Additive and backward-compatible (recruitment
can be backfilled). Standard tags:
`shadow_system · copy_sprawl · external_transfer · vendor_dependency · retention_gap ·
access_gap · purpose_drift · ai_tool · identity_document · physical_record · rights_failure ·
breach_exposure`.

### ⚠️ Reconciling the playbook with the code (3 conflicts — hold to the code)
The playbook is 80% aligned, but three of its numbers will fail `tsc`/tests if authored literally:
1. **Hotspots = EXACTLY 7**, not "5–8". Schema `.length(7)`, ranks 1–7. The canonical 7 is a
   feature; do not deviate.
2. **Stages: 12 canonical**, gated down for display (permanent shows 10). "8–12" means "12
   defined, some hidden by business model", NOT a free choice — a truly shorter lifecycle needs
   the gate test relaxed to a range, which folds into Blocker B.
3. **Variants are a GLOBAL 2-value enum** (`BUSINESS_MODELS`), not per-industry. 3-variant sets
   (CA: Individual/Business/Payroll) need an engine change first — same class as Blocker A. Only
   add a variant where stages/data/systems genuinely differ.
Also: keep **TS packs, not JSON** (`tsc` + `validatePack` catch bad packs at build time — JSON
loses that). Assessment linking is **bucket-level today** (5 per pack), not per-question; per-
question is a good north star but needs Blocker A resolved first.

---

## 6c. Production sequence (adopted from the playbook)
Build in waves, easiest-and-closest-to-recruitment first:
- **Wave 1 — Professional services:** CA Firms → Law Firms → Training Institutes
  (document-heavy, familiar, close to the recruitment model).
- **Wave 2 — High-impact personal data:** Clinics/Labs → Schools → Pharmacies.
- **Wave 3 — Consumer/transaction:** D2C → Real Estate → Hotels → Gyms/Salons.
- **Wave 4 — Financial/complex:** Fintech/NBFC last (heaviest regulatory + vendor overlay;
  matches the assessment pack running hottest at Σcaps 122).

---

## 7. Process gate (before any code)
Same discipline as the industry-assessment packs:
1. Draft the journey content (12 stages, ~28+ nodes, 7 hotspots) as a spec.
2. Run **`/plan-design-review`** on it — average ≥ 8 before building.
3. Prereqs to confirm live first: the industry's assessment (`/assessment/{slug}`), its
   `/industries/{slug}` page, and its Discovery niche in `niche-items.golden.json`. CA has all
   three today.
4. Build → `tsc` clean → tests (structural, parametrised) → `next build` static → browser-verify
   (places reconcile, lane wall correct, chips/legend, keyboard) → branch → preview → ff-merge.

---

## 8. Known open items the framework inherits
- `ASSESSMENT_BUCKETS` generalisation (Blocker A) — do first.
- Test parametrisation (Blocker B) — also relaxes the hardcoded `stages.length === 12` to a
  range if a shorter-lifecycle industry ever needs it.
- **Hotspot `tags` field (§6b taxonomy)** — additive, do alongside pack #2 so the taxonomy is
  established before the data multiplies across 12 industries.
- Per-industry variant sets — `BUSINESS_MODELS` is a global 2-value enum; generalise only when
  an industry genuinely needs 3+ variants.
- Persona *roles* (create/view/edit/share) are NOT modelled — edges carry no persona, and
  `accessPersonaIds` is a flat list. A real schema change if ever wanted; out of scope per pack.
- Tailwind `opacity-25`/`opacity-40` utilities were found NOT emitted by the build — use inline
  `style={{opacity}}` for state-driven opacity (as BoundaryLaneMap does).

---

## Addendum — CA Firms rights & incident walkthroughs (added 2026-08-02)

CA Firms has no sector spec of its own (older handoffs cite one that does not exist), so this record
lives with the framework contract.

Fifth and final pack to author the two shared, opt-in sections, after `schools-colleges`,
`clinics-diagnostic-labs`, `d2c-brands` and `training-institutes`. **Content only** — `scenarios.ts`
plus two lines in `index.ts`. **7 rights · 8 incidents**, none gated: a CA firm declares one journey.

### What makes these CA-specific

**The firm can ACT AS the client.** In every other pack the business holds data *about* a data
principal. A CA firm holds the DSC token — the client's legal signature — and a password sheet
carrying every portal login they have. No other sector in the series has that. Hence
`rs-dsc-and-credentials` and `in-dsc-used-without-instruction`, the most severe incident in the pack.

**Much of the personal data belongs to people who never engaged the firm.** The client's own
employees — salary, PAN, bank, deductions — sit in the accounting files and go to outsourced
processors. `rs-client-employee-data` exists because these people are invisible in most firms'
thinking, and they are data principals with their own rights.

**The relationship ends by transfer, not by lapse.** A client leaves by moving to another CA, and
`rs-changing-my-ca` is where the data question actually gets asked — return of originals, handover of
work product, and deletion of the rest, three different things clients conflate into one request.

### Language locks (tighter here than any other pack)

DPDPA scope only. **No ICAI claims**, no professional-conduct or professional-body retention
schedules, no statements about what tax law requires to be retained or for how long, and no tax or
legal advice. Where retention is referred to, it is framed as something the firm determines with its
own advisers. No "sensitive personal data". The audience are practising professionals and an
overclaim would be spotted instantly.

### ⚠️ Pre-existing hotspot debt now fully diagnosed (NOT introduced here, NOT fixed here)

| Stage | Hotspot nodes resolving there |
|---|---|
| 1 `onboarding` | `personal-whatsapp`, `staff-laptop`, `shared-drive` ← **COLLISION** |
| 3 `documents` | `outsourced-data-entry` |
| 6 `gst-tds` | `password-sheet` |
| 7 `itr-filing` | `dsc-token` |
| 10 `archive` | `old-itr-folders` |

⇒ 7 hotspots, **5 distinct flags**. This is the **collision** mode, and the cause is narrow:
`staff-laptop` and `shared-drive` both use `ALL_STAGES`, so their earliest stage is `onboarding`,
where `personal-whatsapp` already sits.

**The fix is unusually cheap here — no hotspot copy changes at all.** Give the two spanning nodes a
later first stage:

- `shared-drive` → start at `kyc` (2) — the drive is where KYC scans first land
- `staff-laptop` → start at `accounting` (4) — staff download working files once the work starts

That yields flags on stages 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10 = **7 distinct = 7 counter**. Both remain spanning
nodes for every later stage; only their first appearance moves.

It is still a **visible** change (those two stop appearing at the earliest stages), so it was left out
of this content-only cycle and needs Dilip's decision. Compare with
`docs/SaralPrivacy_TrainingInstitutes_DataFlow_Spec.md`, where the equivalent fix is more invasive.

**Remaining after this:** only `recruitment-agencies` lacks scenario content, and it carries the same
collision-mode debt. Once CA, TI and recruitment are corrected, the flags-vs-counter invariant can
land as a universal Tier-1 test.

---

## Addendum — hotspot reconciliation fixed on CA & recruitment, guard test added (2026-08-02)

### The defect

The journey paints one red flag per **distinct stage** a hotspot's node resolves to — each node
resolving to the first of its `stageIds` visible in the selected model. The counter and legend print
`pack.hotspots.length`, which is pack-level and never filtered. When several hotspot nodes share a
first stage they collapse into one flag, and a reader counts five flags under a sentence saying
seven. On a page whose entire argument is *count every place your data ends up*, that undermines the
whole thing.

### What was fixed

**`ca-firms`** — `shared-drive` and `staff-laptop` both used `ALL_STAGES`, so both resolved to
`onboarding` (1), where `personal-whatsapp` already sat: three hotspots, one flag.

- `shared-drive` → starts at `kyc` (2) — where client documents first land in it
- `staff-laptop` → starts at `accounting` (4) — once the work itself begins

Flags now on stages 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10 = **7 = 7**.

**`recruitment-agencies`** — `excel-tracker`, `ai-screener` and `recruiter-laptop` all resolved to
`screening` (3).

- `recruiter-laptop` → `sourcing` (1) **added**, purely additive: CVs are pulled off job portals and
  LinkedIn onto a laptop before anything reaches the ATS
- `ai-screener` → unchanged at `screening` (3); it cannot move, it *is* screening
- `excel-tracker` → `assessment` (5), where the pipeline sheet is actually run from

Flags now on 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 = **7 = 7 in both models**.

**No hotspot copy was rewritten.** Only node `stageIds` changed, and both nodes in each pack remain
spanning nodes for every stage after their new start.

**One judgement call, recorded honestly:** `excel-tracker` lost `screening` from its `stageIds`, so
the `ats-to-tracker` edge (shortlists exported during screening) now fires at a stage earlier than
the node's placement. Edges may cross stages and this renders correctly; only the node's position in
the journey moved. The alternative was moving `recruiter-laptop` instead, which would have created
two such crossings rather than one.

### The guard test

`lib/data-flow/data-flow.test.ts` now asserts the invariant across **every model of every pack**:

> the set of packs whose flags disagree with their counter must be exactly `KNOWN_HOTSPOT_DEBT`

Expressed as a set rather than per pack, so that:

- a **new** pack breaking the invariant fails the test ✅
- `training-institutes` being **fixed** also fails the test, forcing the exception to be removed
  rather than quietly rotting ✅

It is self-proving: the test only passes if it actually *detected* TI's failure and found CA and
recruitment clean. A broken detection would produce an empty failing set and fail the assertion.

### State after this change

| Pack | Models reconciling |
|---|---|
| recruitment-agencies | 2 / 2 ✅ |
| ca-firms | 1 / 1 ✅ |
| d2c-brands | 3 / 3 ✅ |
| clinics-diagnostic-labs | 3 / 3 ✅ |
| schools-colleges | 3 / 3 ✅ |
| training-institutes | 1 / 3 — `classroom`, `online` still short (known debt) |

**12 of 14 model-views**, up from 9. Every *default* view in the series is now correct — TI's default
(`hybrid`) already reconciled, so the remaining mismatch is only visible to someone who deliberately
switches to Classroom or Online.

### Remaining

`training-institutes` is the last one. Its spine is fully shared, so the sole cause is that 4 of its
7 hotspot **nodes** carry `businessModels` gates — fixing it means re-pointing them to ungated
anchors and rewriting four hotspots' copy. That is a content decision about which risks belong on the
headline rail, not a mechanical fix, and it is deliberately left for when that map is next revisited.
Options in `docs/SaralPrivacy_TrainingInstitutes_DataFlow_Spec.md`. When it lands, remove
`training-institutes` from `KNOWN_HOTSPOT_DEBT` — the test will tell you to.
