# SaralPrivacy — Law Firms & Legal Consultants Personal Data Flow Map (Map #7)

**Status:** ✅ **LIVE on production 2026-08-02** (`main` `ee5369e`), signed off on preview by Dilip.
Both gating decisions are SETTLED (§0) — do not re-open them. 61/61 tests green; flags = counter = 8
in all three models. **Seven maps now live.**
**Route:** `/industries/law-firms/data-flow`
**Contract:** `docs/SaralPrivacy_DataFlow_Framework_Spec.md`
**Handoff:** `handoff.md` at the project root
**Precedents:** Schools (multi-model, **gated** spine, default ≠ superset, derived hotspot count) ·
CA firms (closest sibling by content: client matters, documents, portal credentials, a file that
outlives the engagement)

---

## 0. The two gating decisions — ⛔ SETTLED 2026-08-02, do not re-litigate

| Decision | Dilip's call |
|---|---|
| The pasted spec's architecture | **Content-only pack.** Mine its content in full, reject its architecture (§8). No component, schema or route edits. |
| Gate 0 — operating models | **Three, model-gated spine 13/13/16** — `litigation` (default) · `corporate` · `full-service` (superset). §2 stands as written. |

The reasoning behind each is kept below, because the *why* is what stops a future session re-opening
them.

### Decision 1 — the pasted specification's architecture (§9 of the handoff)

A large external specification was pasted in with this build request. As with maps #3, #4, #5 and #6,
it proposes a **bespoke Law-Firms-only engine** — ~40 new `Legal*` components, a parallel
`LegalFlowSystem` / `LegalFlowStage` / `LegalFlowNode` type system, its own metrics module, its own
19-event analytics namespace, 22 graph filters and 10 view modes, and a stateful `LegalHold` state
machine.

That architecture **violates the "presentation unified, content varies" law** and duplicates what the
shared engine already renders pack-driven.

> **Recommendation: content-only pack.** Mine the pasted spec's content inventory in full — it is the
> richest sector input the series has received — and reject its architecture in writing (§8 below).
> Nothing it asks for that a reader would actually *see* is missing from the shared engine today.

The standing answer had changed on map #6 — "content pack + shared-engine additions" — so this was put
to Dilip rather than assumed. **He chose content-only.** The two shared-engine candidates that were
costed and declined for this cycle are recorded in §8: an optional `retentionHold` node badge, and an
authority/public-record graph facet. Neither is required for the map to teach what it needs to teach;
either can be revisited as its own shared cycle if usage justifies it.

### Decision 2 — Gate 0: three operating models (§3 of the handoff)

The handoff flagged "law firms are single-journey like CA" as an **untested guess** and named the real
candidate split. The pasted spec independently proposed the same three. **Dilip confirmed three**, on
the argument set out in §2: litigation and corporate differ in *process*, not merely in scale — a
litigation practice has no data room and files affidavits into a public record; a corporate practice
receives other people's personal data in bulk and files with the MCA. The old "single-journey like CA"
guess is now **retired**, not merely untested.

---

## 1. The sector's shape

Recruitment is a pipeline that flows once. A CA firm is a loop that recurs yearly. A training
institute is a lifecycle with an end. D2C is a funnel that never closes. A clinic is a record that
outlives the visit. Education is a permanent record accumulated by proxy.

**A law firm is an adversarial record that becomes public by design.** Two things are true here that
are true nowhere else in the series:

1. **The opposing side is a designed recipient.** Data is gathered specifically in order to be used
   against someone. The other party, their counsel, the court and often the police receive copies —
   not as a leak, but as the point of the exercise. Every other map in this series treats "it reached
   someone outside" as the failure. Here it is the workflow.
2. **Filing makes it public, and the client cannot take it back.** A pleading, an affidavit, an
   annexure — bank statements, a medical report, a chat log, a child's custody details — becomes part
   of a public record. No consent withdrawal, no erasure request and no change of lawyer reverses it.

There is a third feature that shapes the whole map: **most of the personal data in a matter belongs
to people who never engaged the firm.** Opposing parties, witnesses, family members, the target
company's employees in a data room. They have no engagement letter, no notice, and usually no idea
the firm holds their records.

**Signature exposure (hotspot #1):** *the annexure that should have been redacted.* The moment a firm
files high-impact client and third-party data into a public record, its control ends permanently.
That single act is the sector's equivalent of the school publishing a child's face.

---

## 2. Operating models

| id | Label | Stages | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `litigation` | Litigation & dispute resolution | 13 | **DEFAULT** (drives the `/data-mapping` card stats) |
| `corporate` | Corporate, transactional & advisory | 13 | — |
| `full-service` | Full-service multi-office firm | 16 | **SUPERSET** (appears in every gated tag) |

Default ≠ superset — the schools and D2C pattern. `litigation` is first because it is what most Indian
firms and independent advocates searching this actually run; `full-service` is the superset because it
genuinely runs both practices plus central knowledge management.

### Why this is a process split, not a scale split

The test the handoff sets is whether the models differ in *process* or only in *systems*. They differ
in process, in both directions:

- A litigation practice **collects evidence about third parties** and **files it into a public
  record**. It has no data room, no due-diligence request list and no closing set.
- A corporate practice **receives other people's personal data in bulk** — a target company's entire
  employee file set — into a data room with access groups and bidders, and never files an affidavit.
  Its "authority" is the MCA or a sector regulator, not a court registry.
- A full-service firm runs both **and** adds something neither has alone: a central precedent and
  knowledge system, ethical walls between practices, and matter data reused for pitches and
  directories across offices.

**The stage spine is therefore model-gated** (recruitment / clinics / schools precedent). Counts are
free in this framework — 13 / 13 / 16 is what the sector produced and was not forced to match. The
pasted spec's "10 stages per variant" is rejected for exactly this reason (§8).

### Stage spine — union order

Eleven of the sixteen stages are **all-model**; five are gated.

| seq | id | Name | Models |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `enquiry` | Enquiry, conflict check & the first conversation | all |
| 2 | `engagement` | Engagement, KYC & matter opening | all |
| 3 | `intake` | Instructions, documents & client uploads | all |
| 4 | `evidence` | Evidence, witnesses & third-party records | `litigation`, `full-service` |
| 5 | `diligence` | Due diligence & the data room | `corporate`, `full-service` |
| 6 | `matter-file` | The matter file, DMS & working copies | all |
| 7 | `analysis` | Research, analysis & AI-assisted drafting | all |
| 8 | `drafting` | Drafting, review & client approval | all |
| 9 | `external` | External counsel, experts, translators & agents | all |
| 10 | `authority` | Court, tribunal & regulatory filing | all |
| 11 | `hearing` | Hearings, orders, settlement & enforcement | `litigation`, `full-service` |
| 12 | `closing` | Signing, closing sets & completion | `corporate`, `full-service` |
| 13 | `billing` | Time recording, billing & expenses | all |
| 14 | `knowledge` | Precedent bank, knowledge reuse & cross-office pitching | `full-service` |
| 15 | `closure` | Matter closure, legal hold & return of documents | all |
| 16 | `archive` | Archives, backups & the record room | all |

- **litigation** sees 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11,13,15,16 = **13**
- **corporate** sees 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,13,15,16 = **13**
- **full-service** sees all = **16**

`authority` is deliberately all-model: every one of these firms submits personal data to a body with
its own publication and retention rules. *Which* body differs — court registry vs MCA vs a sector
regulator — and that is content, not structure. Keeping it all-model is also what lets the signature
hotspot sit on an all-model stage (§3).

**Gating convention:** the shared core carries **no** `businessModels` tag; each gated entity tags
itself with **its own model + `full-service`** (the superset).

---

## 3. The hotspot count is DERIVED, not chosen

Guard test (a) — `hotspots reconcile with the counter in every model of every pack` — makes the
recurring flags-vs-counter defect unshippable. The construction it requires: **every hotspot node
ungated, and its earliest stage a distinct all-model stage.**

Eleven stages are all-model. Eight of them carry a hotspot:

| Stage (seq) | Hotspot node | Rank | The failure in one line |
|---|---|---|---|
| `authority` (10) | `court-filing-portal` | **1** | Filing an unredacted annexure makes it public permanently |
| `intake` (3) | `client-whatsapp` | 2 | The client's evidence dump — including other people's records — lands on a personal phone |
| `matter-file` (6) | `matter-dms` | 3 | Everyone in the firm can open every matter, including family and criminal files |
| `external` (9) | `external-counsel` | 4 | The whole file goes out when a subset would do, with no record of who holds what |
| `analysis` (7) | `public-ai-tool` | 5 | Client facts pasted into a consumer AI tool to summarise or draft |
| `archive` (16) | `firm-archive-backup` | 6 | Nothing is ever deleted — "in case of appeal", forever |
| `engagement` (2) | `kyc-id-folder` | 7 | Aadhaar and PAN copies collected by default and never minimised |
| `billing` (13) | `billing-narrative` | 8 | Matter facts written into time entries and invoices that finance and the client's AP both read |

⇒ **flags = 8 = counter in all three models, by arithmetic.**

`enquiry`, `drafting` and `closure` are all-model but carry no hotspot — that is fine and expected
(schools ran 8 hotspots across 11 all-model stages). A hotspot node **may span later stages** — the
DMS genuinely does — but must never acquire an *earlier* one, which would move its flag in some models
and break reconciliation.

### Deliberately NOT hotspots, because they sit on model-gated stages

Each of these is authored as a **critical-risk node** with its own `riskWhy` / `riskAction` and renders
in full wherever it exists — it simply does not carry a red flag, because a gated flag would make the
counter lie in the models that hide it:

- the **data room** a bidder can still export from after the deal dies (`diligence`)
- **evidence media** — call recordings, device extractions, screenshots of someone else's chats
  (`evidence`)
- the **hearing recording and transcript** downloaded to a junior's laptop (`hearing`)
- the **closing set** duplicated across e-signature, email, bank and archive (`closing`)
- the **precedent bank** that kept the client's name in a template (`knowledge`)

---

## 4. Computed reference model

**Verified from the built pack**, not targets. Every published metric is computed by
`computePackSummary` / `filterByBusinessModel` — none is hand-typed into copy.

| | litigation | corporate | full-service |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stages | 13 | 13 | 16 |
| Distinct places (systems) | 48 | 48 | 58 |
| External parties | 25 | 25 | 28 |
| External transfers | 67 | 73 | 91 |
| Copies created | 118 | 121 | 156 |
| Hotspots (flags = counter) | 8 = 8 ✅ | 8 = 8 ✅ | 8 = 8 ✅ |

Pack totals: **16 stages · 69 nodes · 179 edges · 16 data categories · 15 personas · 8 hotspots ·
8 rights scenarios · 8 incident scenarios.**

The two 13-stage models land on the same system count by coincidence, not by design — they overlap on
the eleven all-model stages and each add two of their own.

### Data categories — 16

Sixteen, not the pasted spec's 51. Past ~16 the legend stops communicating and every node renders a
wall of tags; the fine distinctions live in each category's `examples`.

| id | Covers | kind |
|---|---|---|
| `client-identity` | Name, contact, address, authorised representative | collected |
| `client-kyc` | PAN, Aadhaar, passport, company KYC, beneficial owner | collected |
| `matter-metadata` | Matter type, parties, court/forum, status, conflict-check result | collected |
| `instructions-communications` | Emails, WhatsApp threads, voice notes, attendance notes | collected |
| `financial-records` | Bank statements, tax filings, salary slips, funds flow | collected |
| `property-corporate-docs` | Title deeds, agreements, board resolutions, MCA records | collected |
| `employment-hr-records` | Employee files, disciplinary records, payroll schedules | collected |
| `health-records` | Medical reports, injury records, mental-health material | collected |
| `allegation-records` | Criminal allegations, harassment complaints, matrimonial facts | collected |
| `evidence-media` | Screenshots, photos, video, call recordings, device extractions | collected |
| `third-party-records` | Opposing party, witness, family member, target-company employee | collected |
| `court-filings` | Pleadings, affidavits, annexures, orders, regulatory filings | created |
| `legal-work-product` | Advice, opinions, drafts, strategy and settlement notes | derived |
| `case-assessment` | Risk ratings, outcome predictions, AI summaries, client profitability | derived |
| `billing-time` | Time entries, narratives, invoices, expense receipts, payments | collected |
| `staff-access-record` | Logins, DMS access logs, device and portal credentials | created |

`third-party-records` is the category doing the sector's distinctive work — it is how the map shows
that most of the personal data in a matter belongs to people the firm has no relationship with.
`case-assessment` and `legal-work-product` are marked `derived`: the quiet half that a firm rarely
counts as personal data at all.

### Named software — the "that's my firm" test

Generic "practice management system" fails it. Name what the sector actually runs: matter-management
software, the DMS and the shared drive beside it, the **clerk's diary**, e-filing and cause-list
portals, the **court registry counter**, dictation and outsourced transcription, e-discovery
platforms, virtual data rooms, e-signature, the **precedent drive**, partner and associate laptops,
personal WhatsApp, the **physical file room and evidence boxes**, and the boot of the car they travel
in.

---

## 5. Language locks — tighter here than any other pack

The audience *are* lawyers. An overclaim will be spotted on the first read and will cost the map its
credibility, so these are stricter than the series default.

- **"High-impact client data", never "sensitive personal data."** The DPDPA creates no such statutory
  category. That is GDPR-tier language and would be a factual error dressed as rigour.
- **DPDPA scope only.** No Bar Council of India rules, no advocate–client **privilege** doctrine, no
  professional-conduct claims, no court-rule or statutory retention schedule. Privilege is real and
  important — this map simply does not opine on it. Describe **custody and control**, never legal
  status.
- **No legal advice**, and no accusation. Frame everything by custody and DPDPA obligation. "Where the
  file is" is a fact; "you are in breach" is not ours to say.
- **Erasure needs unusual care.** Unlike every other sector in the series, a litigation file has
  genuine grounds to be retained. The map must never imply everything should be deletable. CA's
  `rs-changing-my-ca` and the schools erasure scenario are the models: **separate what must be kept
  from what merely has been kept.**
- **Confidentiality ≠ readiness.** The industry page already draws this line and the map must hold it:
  a firm can be scrupulous about confidentiality and still have no idea where the copies are.

---

## 6. The two walkthrough sections

Mandatory build step, not optional (handoff §4 Step E). Copy `lib/data/data-flow/ca-firms/scenarios.ts`
— closest sibling, and its language-lock header is the model for the tighter locks above. Every
referenced node must be visible in every model where the scenario shows.

### Rights scenarios — 8

| id | The request, in their words | Type | Models |
|---|---|---|---|
| `rs-return-my-documents` | "I'm changing lawyers. Give me my file back." | access | all |
| `rs-annexure-not-redacted` | "You filed my bank statements without redacting them." | correction | all |
| `rs-delete-my-closed-matter` | "The matter ended two years ago. Delete my file." | erasure | all |
| `rs-correct-my-details` | "My address on the record is wrong." | correction | all |
| `rs-opposing-party-asks` | "Your client's lawyer has my bank statements. Where from, and delete them." | access | `litigation`, `full-service` |
| `rs-my-hr-file-was-in-a-data-room` | "My employment file was shown to a bidder." | access | `corporate`, `full-service` |
| `rs-stop-the-firm-newsletter` | "Stop sending me event invitations." | withdraw-marketing | all |
| `rs-an-intern-read-my-file` | "An intern discussed my matter outside the firm." | complaint | all |

**`blockedNodeIds` is the honest half of this section, and it carries more weight here than anywhere
else in the series.** `rs-annexure-not-redacted` must name the court registry and the public record as
genuinely unreachable — a walkthrough implying a firm can un-file a document would be worse than no
walkthrough. `rs-opposing-party-asks` is mostly blocked too, and saying so plainly is the point.

### Incident scenarios — 8

| id | Title | Severity | Models |
|---|---|---|---|
| `inc-unredacted-annexure-filed` | An annexure was filed without redaction | critical | all |
| `inc-wrong-recipient-email` | The draft went to the opposing side | critical | all |
| `inc-ai-tool-upload` | A junior pasted matter facts into a public AI tool | high | all |
| `inc-open-cloud-link` | A matter-folder share link is still live | high | all |
| `inc-ex-associate-access` | A departed associate still has DMS access | high | all |
| `inc-lost-case-file` | A case bundle was left in a car or at court | high | all |
| `inc-data-room-export` | A bidder downloaded employee files after the deal died | critical | `corporate`, `full-service` |
| `inc-whatsapp-status-leak` | Matter status was posted to the wrong group | medium | all |

Labelled an **operational response reference**, explicitly not breach-notification advice — the shared
`IncidentSimulator` already carries that framing.

---

## 7. Verified inputs (re-checked against source, 2026-08-02)

| Field | Value | Verified against |
|---|---|---|
| Sector slug | `law-firms` | — |
| `assessmentRoute` | `/assessment/law-firms` | route exists |
| Industry page | `app/industries/law-firms/page.tsx` | exists |
| `discoveryNicheId` | **`law-firms`** — exact-match slug | `lib/discovery/data.generated.ts` (`advocate` and `legaltech` also exist; `advocate` would be right only if we modelled solo practice, `legaltech` is a different business) |
| `lexicon` | `subject: "client"` · `subjectArtefact: "One client's matter file"` · `org: "firm"` | reads correctly in "outside your firm" for all three models |

**`assessmentBuckets`** — verified against `lib/data/industry-assessment/packs/law-firms.ts`:

```
client_matter_data
case_evidence_sensitivity
document_sharing_court_workflow
staff_junior_vendor_access
retention_incident_readiness
```

All five must be reachable from the hotspot rail, **and all five must appear in the assessment
client's `BUCKET_FOCUS`** or guard test (b) fails. Suggested mapping of the eight hotspots:

| Hotspot | Bucket |
|---|---|
| `court-filing-portal` | `document_sharing_court_workflow` |
| `client-whatsapp` | `document_sharing_court_workflow` |
| `matter-dms` | `staff_junior_vendor_access` |
| `external-counsel` | `staff_junior_vendor_access` |
| `public-ai-tool` | `case_evidence_sensitivity` |
| `firm-archive-backup` | `retention_incident_readiness` |
| `kyc-id-folder` | `client_matter_data` |
| `billing-narrative` | `client_matter_data` |

### ⚠️ Assessment-client work is required and test-enforced

| Check | State |
|---|---|
| `<Suspense>` on `app/assessment/law-firms/page.tsx` | ❌ **MISSING — must be added, or `next build` fails** |
| `useSearchParams` in `LawFirmAssessmentClient.tsx` | ❌ **not present — must be added** |

Copy `app/assessment/schools-colleges/page.tsx` and its client's `?bucket=` + `BUCKET_FOCUS` + teal
focus-banner pattern. This is the one place `useSearchParams` is correct — the assessment is
`noindex`. The data-flow client is the opposite case and must never use it (handoff §6).

### `boundaryLabels`

`government` is unusually load-bearing here (courts, tribunals, registries, regulators) and `public`
is the sector's signature — a filed document *is* public. Proposed:

| Boundary | Label |
|---|---|
| `candidate` | The client |
| `agency` | Your firm |
| `client` | Counterparties & their advisors |
| `vendor` | Legal-tech & service vendors |
| `government` | Courts, tribunals & regulators |
| `third-party` | Others who receive it |
| `public` | On the public record |

---

## 8. §14 — What this build deliberately does NOT do

The pasted specification proposed a bespoke Law-Firms-only engine. Per the established response (maps
#3, #4, #5, #6), its **content inventory is mined in full** and its **architecture is rejected in
writing**. Every deviation is recorded here rather than silently dropped.

| Spec asked for | Not built | Why |
|---|---|---|
| ~40 new `Legal*` components (`LegalFlowPage`, `LegalVariantSelector`, `LegalStageCard`, `MatterAccessMatrix`, …) | ❌ | Violates "presentation unified, content varies". The shared engine already renders all of it pack-driven. A parallel tree means maps #8–#12 diverge from #1–#7. |
| `LegalFlowSystem` / `LegalFlowStage` / `LegalFlowNode` / `LegalFlowEdge` parallel types | ❌ | The existing `FlowNode` / `FlowStage` / `FlowEdge` schemas carry every field that renders. A second type system forks validation, both guard tests and the 7 per-pack tests. |
| 51 data categories | ❌ — **16 authored** | Past ~16 the legend stops communicating. Fine distinctions (translation/notarisation, hearing records, expert reports, chain of custody) live as `examples`. |
| 36-value `LegalRelationshipType` taxonomy | ❌ | The 7 boundaries already answer the question that changes the fix: is it inside the firm, at a vendor, at an authority, or public. A 36-way split renders as noise. |
| `LegalFlowMetrics` with 19 counters | ❌ | `computePackSummary` plus the journey's cumulative counters derive every metric that is displayed. Unrendered counters are not metrics. |
| `LegalHold` state machine (8 statuses, owner, review/release dates, audit history) | ❌ | This is an *operational system a firm would run*, not a reference model. The map's job is to show that a closed matter is retained by default with nobody owning the decision — carried by hotspot #6 and `rs-delete-my-closed-matter`. **If Dilip wants a shared-engine addition this cycle, an optional `retentionHold` node attribute is the one candidate worth costing** — but it is a badge, not a workflow. |
| 22 graph filters (evidence only, sensitive matters only, ethical-wall systems, legal-hold systems, …) | ⚠️ partial | Risk and connection-type filters exist, plus the table view. A 22-facet filter bar on a reference model is a research tool, not a teaching one. An `authority / public-record` facet is the only one with a real sector argument; reconsider as a shared cycle if usage justifies it. |
| 10 view modes — recipient matrix, matter-access matrix, evidence-location matrix, rights-coverage view, legal-hold overlay | ❌ | Five more views of the same ~58 nodes. The lane board, the accessible table view and the node drawer answer the same questions in three ways already. |
| "10 stages per variant" | ❌ — **13 / 13 / 16** | Forcing equal counts to look tidy is explicitly against the framework. Litigation has no data room; corporate files no affidavit. |
| 19 `legal_flow_*` analytics events | ⚠️ partial | Reuse the shared `trackEvent.dataFlow` namespace. A per-sector event namespace makes cross-map comparison impossible — the exact thing the OMTM needs. |
| FAQ schema on the data-flow page | ❌ | There are no visible FAQs on this page. Emitting FAQ schema without them is precisely what the content/trust audit flagged. (The *industry* page has real FAQs and keeps its schema.) |
| Content path `src/content/data-flow/law-firms/` | ❌ | Repo convention is `lib/data/data-flow/law-firms/`. Same shape, existing path. |
| Privilege / professional-conduct / Bar Council handling attributes | ❌ | Out of DPDPA scope and outside what this map may responsibly assert (§5). Custody and control only. |
| "Return-of-documents workflow" as a stateful simulator | ❌ — **a rights scenario** | `rs-return-my-documents` says the same thing in the section Dilip rates highest, with no new component. |
| Lighthouse 90+ / a11y 95+ / responsive at 7 widths, verified | ⏳ **not measured** | Never measured on any of the six live maps. Flagged as an open item — **not claimed** (§9). |
| Move the `/data-mapping` card to "Available maps" after approval | ✅ automatic | The single registry line does it. It shows on the **preview** for review; production is unchanged until Dilip merges. |

**Also worth flagging:** the pasted spec asks for a `?model=` URL state and an accessible table
fallback as if they were new. **Both already exist** — added in the map #6 cycle and inherited by
every pack (`DataFlowClient.tsx`, `FlowSystemTable.tsx`). No work needed.

---

## 9. Known limitations — stated, not hidden

1. **Lighthouse, axe and responsive behaviour have never been measured on any map in this series.**
   The pasted spec asks for 90+/95+/95+/95+ and 320–1440 verification. Do not begin claiming them
   here. A related measured defect is already on record: white on `green-500` is **2.54:1** against a
   4.5:1 bar, and that is the primary CTA on all six live data-flow pages and would be on this one.
2. **Content not domain-reviewed.** Like every pack before it, the sector detail is authored from the
   framework, the assessment pack and the pasted spec — **not** validated by a practising advocate or
   firm. For this sector that gap matters more than usual, because the audience are the domain
   experts. Worth a review pass before it is promoted anywhere.
3. **`third-party-records` describes people the firm cannot notify.** The map shows their data
   honestly; it does not pretend there is a clean DPDPA answer for a witness whose statement sits in a
   file. `rs-opposing-party-asks` is deliberately mostly-blocked for that reason.
4. **`knowledge` is gated to `full-service` only.** Plenty of two-partner firms keep a precedent drive.
   Gating it keeps the three models genuinely distinct rather than near-identical; the precedent risk
   still appears for the other two models as node-level risk copy on the DMS.
5. **Flags-vs-counter debt elsewhere is untouched.** `training-institutes` still mismatches on 2 of 3
   models and remains in `KNOWN_HOTSPOT_DEBT`. This pack must not be built in a way that adds to it —
   §3's construction plus guard test (a) is what prevents that.

---

## 10. Build order

§0's decisions are settled, so the handoff's recipe applies unchanged:

1. **Author the pack** — `lib/data/data-flow/law-firms/` (8 files, schools-colleges shape).
   **Hotspot nodes first** (§3), then everything else around them.
2. **Register** — one line in `lib/data/data-flow/index.ts`, one in `lib/data-flow/data-flow.test.ts`.
   **Expect 61 tests** (54 today + 7 per-pack).
3. **Surface** — `<DataFlowPreview>` on `app/industries/law-firms/page.tsx`, above "How the 3-minute
   scan works".
4. **Assessment deep-links** — `<Suspense>` + `useSearchParams` + all five buckets in `BUCKET_FOCUS`
   (§7). Test-enforced.
5. **Verify** — the test run, then the unenforced-constraint script from handoff §5 across **all three
   models**, requiring `flags=8 counter=8 OK` and no `!!` lines. Then `npm run build`.
6. **Preview → sign-off → prod.** Push, hand Dilip the branch alias, **stop**. Never self-merge.

Realistic cost: ~8–12h, ~85–90% of it writing content.

This spec is map #7's content and decision record; the handoff is its build procedure.
