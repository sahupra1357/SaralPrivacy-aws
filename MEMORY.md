Helps Indian businesses understand and comply with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 and DPDP Rules, 2025 — without legalese.

Revenue model: Free educational content + paid consultation (`/contact`).
Target: SMBs, recruitment agencies, CA firms, training institutes, D2C brands.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | Next.js 16.1.7 (App Router) |
| UI | React 19.2.3, Tailwind CSS |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Database | Appwrite (blog posts, subscribers) |
| Deployment | Vercel (auto-deploy on push to `main`) |
| Region | `sin1` (Singapore) |
| Git remote | `https://github.com/SahuDilip1356/SaralPrivacy.git` |
| Active branch | `main` |
| Other branch | `feature/email-report-upgrade` (paused) |

---

## Deployment Rules (CRITICAL)

- **ALWAYS deploy via `git commit → git push origin main`** — never use Vercel deploy tools directly.
- Vercel GitHub webhook must be connected. If deploys stop triggering, check Vercel Settings → Git.
- `rootDirectory = webapp` in Vercel Dashboard — never clear this.
- One `package.json` at `webapp/webapp/` only — no duplicate Next.js apps.
- One middleware file: `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16), never `middleware.ts` alongside it.

## Key Architectural Decisions

| Decision | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| `learnNav.ts` is single source of truth | All sidebars (Act reader, Rules page, future learn pages) import `topicNav` from here. Never hardcode sidebar nav again. |
| Act content in `content/dpdp-act-2023.ts` | Typed data file (not hardcoded JSX) so content is reusable and maintainable |
| Keyword highlighting via regex split | `highlightKeywords()` in Act page — 3 colour categories, no dangerouslySetInnerHTML |
| Dropdown uses 150ms close delay | `useRef` timer prevents gap-close bug when mousing to dropdown panel |
| PDF as authoritative source | Act text sourced from Gazette of India PDF (pypdf extraction), NOT dpdpa.com (inaccurate) |

---

## Shared Nav — `learnNav.ts` (topicNav order)

Order must be maintained consistently across Header dropdown, /learn page, and all sidebars:

1. DPDP Act 2023 (Full Text) → `/learn/dpdp-act-2023`
2. DPDP Rules 2025 → `/learn/dpdp-rules-2025-plain-english-guide`
3. What is DPDPA? → `/learn/what-is-dpdpa`
4. Who It Applies To → `/learn/applicability`
5. Must Learn: Key Terms → `/learn/key-terms`
6. Consent → `/learn/consent`
7. Notice Requirements → `/learn/notice`
8. Rights → `/learn/rights`
9. Business Duties → `/learn/duties`
10. Children's Data → `/learn/childrens-data`
11. Data Breach → `/learn/data-breach`
12. Penalties → `/penalty-calculator`
13. Retention → `/learn/retention`
14. Cross-Border → `/learn/cross-border`
15. Myth vs Fact → `/learn/myths`
16. Glossary (50+ Terms) → `/glossary` ← **always last**

## Development Log

### 2026-04-30 — Session: Act reader + nav fixes

**Commits pushed (all to `main`):**

| Hash | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `2079f50` | chore: activate Vercel webhook after reconnect (empty commit, fixed broken deploy pipeline) |
| `7db4fc7` | feat: add DPDP Act 2023 full-text reader page |
| `1dcbaa0` | fix: dropdown hover gap, learn page cards, Act reader UX improvements |
| `1344beb` | fix: align nav sequence, Glossary last, two-row reading guide |

**Files created:**
- `webapp/content/dpdp-act-2023.ts` — 9 chapters, 44 sections, 7-item Schedule; types: `ActChapter`, `ActSection`, `ScheduleRow`; exports: `dpdpAct2023`, `allSections`
- `webapp/app/learn/dpdp-act-2023/page.tsx` — three-column reader layout; keyword highlighting (3 colours); `#` notation for sections; TOC by chapter; Schedule table

**Files modified:**
- `webapp/lib/learnNav.ts` — added Act + Rules entries; Glossary moved to last (position 16)
- `webapp/components/layout/Header.tsx` — added `useRef` close timer (150ms); dropdown rewritten (10 items, correct order); panel widened to `w-64`
- `webapp/app/learn/page.tsx` — card order rewritten (Act first, Glossary last); Penalty card added; two-row reading guide (Row 1 = clickable learning path, Row 2 = navy reference chips)
- `webapp/app/learn/dpdp-rules-2025-plain-english-guide/page.tsx` — removed hardcoded `guideNav`; now imports and renders `topicNav` from `learnNav.ts`
- `webapp/app/sitemap.ts` — added `/learn/dpdp-act-2023` at priority 0.9; LEARN_UPDATED bumped to 2026-04-30
- `webapp/public/llms.txt` — Act and Rules reader entries added

**Infrastructure:**
- Vercel GitHub webhook was completely missing (deleted). Fixed: reconnected GitHub integration in Vercel Settings → Git. Webhook now active.

---

## Current Pause Point

All work from this session is committed and live on production.
Latest commit on `main`: `ec61bff`
Vercel deploy: triggered automatically on push.

**Remaining / not committed:**
- Template download feature (`TemplateDownloadForm.tsx`, `TemplateDownloadModal.tsx`, `webapp/app/api/templates/`, `webapp/lib/templates/`) — untracked, has TypeScript errors, needs missing dependencies before it can be committed.

---

### 2026-04-30 — Block 4: Expand 5 thin learn pages

**Commit:** `ec61bff`
**File changed:** `webapp/app/learn/[topic]/page.tsx` (1 file, +311 / -116 lines)

| Page | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| what-is-dpdpa | 448 words | 916 words |
| applicability | 403 words | 846 words |
| consent | 437 words | 1081 words |
| rights | 509 words | 1044 words |
| data-breach | 631 words | 1074 words |

New sections added per page:
- **what-is-dpdpa**: GDPR comparison table, implementation timeline, penalty overview, First Three Steps
- **applicability**: Size doesn't matter section, business-type table, SDF tier, 5-question scope test
- **consent**: Deemed Consent (Section 7), context examples (ecommerce/HR/WhatsApp), record-keeping fields, 7-item checklist
- **rights**: Why rights matter operationally, 4 scenario walkthroughs, response guidance, min. process requirements
- **data-breach**: Section 2(t) definition, breach vs incident test, DPDP Rules two-part notification detail, individual notification, penalties table

---

### 2026-04-30 — Block 5: FAQPage JSON-LD on 4 industry pages

**Commit:** `8682628`
**Files changed:** 4 industry pages (+100 / -4 lines)

| Page | FAQs added |
|------|-----------|
| `/industries/recruitment-agencies` | 5 FAQs: DPDPA applies? / CV sharing consent / ATS retention / Aadhaar copies / erasure requests |
| `/industries/ca-firms` | 5 FAQs: DPDPA applies? / Google Drive for PAN-Aadhaar / retention periods / outsourced bookkeeping / client deletion rights |
| `/industries/training-institutes` | 5 FAQs: DPDPA applies? / parental consent under-18 / admissions form compliance / placement data for marketing / tracking pixels |
| `/industries/d2c-brands` | 5 FAQs: DPDPA applies? / WhatsApp from order data / pre-ticked checkbox legality / Meta Pixel/GA disclosure / retention after last purchase |

**Pattern used:** `import { breadcrumbSchema, faqPageSchema }` + `const faqs = [...]` above component + `{faqPageSchema(faqs)}` injected after `{breadcrumbSchema(...)}` in JSX fragment. No new deps required — `faqPageSchema` already existed in `lib/schema.tsx`.

---

---

### 2026-04-30 — Block 6: Related Briefings in article body (mobile)

**Commit:** `d501baa`
**File changed:** `webapp/app/briefings/[slug]/page.tsx` (+54 lines)

- Added "More on this topic" section inside the main content column (`lg:hidden`)
- Appears at the bottom of the article on mobile/tablet — desktop already shows related in the sidebar
- Added to **both** renderers: v2 (new 6-block format) and legacy (v0/v1)
- Only renders when `related.length > 0` — safe fallback, no empty state needed
- Uses `related` array already fetched by `getRelatedFromDb` — zero new queries
- Style: white card, category label (green), title (navy → green on hover), date (slate), ArrowRight icon

---

---

### 2026-04-30 — Block 7: Sitemap + llms.txt housekeeping

**Commit:** `3b321da`
**Files changed:** `webapp/app/sitemap.ts`, `webapp/public/llms.txt`

- `INDUSTRY_UPDATED` bumped from `2026-03-20` → `2026-04-30` (reflects Block 5 FAQ additions)
- `llms.txt` industry guide entries expanded with FAQ topic descriptions — LLMs can now surface industry-specific Q&As

---

## Sprint 8 — COMPLETE ✅

| Block | Deliverable | Commit |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Block 4 | Expand 5 thin learn pages (916–1081 words each) | `ec61bff` |
| Block 5 | FAQPage JSON-LD on 4 industry pages (20 FAQs) | `8682628` |
| Block 6 | "More on this topic" in briefing body (mobile) | `d501baa` |
| Block 7 | Sitemap + llms.txt date/content update | `3b321da` |

### 2026-04-30 — Cross-linking Phase 1: Act + Rules pages

**Commit:** `b002878`
**Files created:** `webapp/lib/termLinks.ts`, `webapp/lib/linkifyText.tsx`
**Files modified:** `webapp/app/learn/dpdp-act-2023/page.tsx`, `webapp/app/learn/dpdp-rules-2025-plain-english-guide/page.tsx`

**What was built:**
- `termLinks.ts` — 29-term TERM_LINKS map (single source of truth). Each entry: `term`, `href` (optional), `className` (blue/green/amber). Ordered longest-first for correct regex alternation.
- `linkifyText.tsx` — utility function. Takes a string, splits by TERM_REGEX, wraps first occurrence of each term in `<Link>` with dotted underline, subsequent occurrences in `<span>` (highlight only). Per-call `Set<string>` tracks seen terms.
- Act page: removed `HIGHLIGHT_TERMS`, `HIGHLIGHT_REGEX`, `highlightKeywords()` — replaced with `linkifyText()` in `OfficialText`, `PlainEnglishBox`, `KeyTakeaways` components. Covers all 44 sections.
- Rules page: `BulletList` and `SubBulletList` now call `linkifyText()` on each item. Covers all 23 Rules + 7 Schedules bullet content.

**Term destinations (sample):**
- Data Fiduciary → `/glossary#data-fiduciary`
- Consent → `/learn/consent`
- Personal Data Breach → `/learn/data-breach`
- Penalty → `/penalty-calculator`
- Data Protection Board → `/glossary#dpb`

**Cross-linking Phases remaining:**
- **Phase 2:** Glossary outbound links + Learn pages cross-links
- **Phase 3:** Briefings — `linkifyText()` on dynamic Appwrite body text

---

---

### 2026-04-30 — Cross-linking Phase 2A: Glossary outbound links

**Commits:** `cc14e0d`
**Files modified:** `webapp/components/glossary/glossaryData.ts`, `webapp/components/glossary/GlossaryClient.tsx`

**What was built:**
- Added `learnHref?: string` to `GlossaryTerm` interface
- Added `learnHref` to all 50 glossary terms (100% coverage):
  - roles → `/learn/duties`, `/learn/rights`, `/learn/key-terms`, `/penalty-calculator`
  - concepts → `/learn/what-is-dpdpa`, `/learn/data-breach`, `/learn/key-terms`, `/learn/consent`
  - consent → `/learn/consent`, `/learn/notice`, `/learn/duties`
  - rights → `/learn/rights`
  - obligations → `/learn/duties`, `/learn/data-breach`, `/learn/retention`, `/learn/childrens-data`, `/learn/key-terms`
  - cross-border → `/learn/cross-border`
  - enforcement → `/penalty-calculator`
  - exemptions → `/learn/what-is-dpdpa`, `/learn/consent`
- `GlossaryClient.tsx` footer updated: single border-t row, `See also:` left + `Read more in the Guide →` right
  - "Read more" only renders when `term.learnHref` exists
  - Row only renders when term has at least one of relatedIds OR learnHref

---

---

### 2026-04-30 — Cross-linking Phase 2B: Related topics strip on Learn pages

**Commit:** `9f485d9`
**File modified:** `webapp/app/learn/[topic]/page.tsx`

**What was built:**
- Added `RELATED_TOPICS` constant (12 topic slugs → 3 related slugs each)
- "Related topics" chip strip rendered between disclaimer and prev/next nav
- Chips are rounded-full, slate background → green on hover
- Only renders for topics that have entries in RELATED_TOPICS
- Zero new dependencies — reuses `topicNav` labels and hrefs

---

## Cross-linking Summary (Phases complete)

| Phase | What | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| Phase 1 | `termLinks.ts` + `linkifyText.tsx` applied to Act reader + Rules page | ✅ `b002878` |
| Phase 2A | `learnHref` on all 50 glossary terms + "Read more" link in GlossaryClient | ✅ `cc14e0d` |
| Phase 2B | Related topics chip strip on all 12 `[topic]` Learn pages | ✅ `9f485d9` |
| Phase 3 | Apply `linkifyText()` to briefing body text (Appwrite strings) | 🔜 Deferred |

---

## Next Recommended Action

**Cross-linking Phase 3 (deferred — complex):**
- Apply `linkifyText()` to dynamic briefing body text (Appwrite-sourced strings)
- Needs server-side text processor; worth doing when briefing volume grows

**Other parked work:**
- **Template download feature:** install `react-hook-form`, `@hookform/resolvers/zod`, missing UI components. Tackle separately.
- **`feature/email-report-upgrade` branch** — review, merge or discard

**Latest commit on `main`:** `9f485d9`

Start next session by reading this file, then run `git status --short webapp/` to verify repo state.

## 2026-09-18 — Rebuild wave 0 (Next.js frontend + FastAPI backend + Postgres)

- `webapp/` renamed to `frontend/` (plain mv; git frozen until manual acceptance — see root CLAUDE.md rule 9).
- New `backend/` (FastAPI, SQLModel, Alembic, uv), `docker-compose.yml` + override, `Makefile`, `.env.example`, `db/init/`.
- Core contracts in `backend/app/api/deps.py` and `backend/app/services/`; migration 0001 (schemas, uuid_v7, login_attempts).
- Frontend proxy route `app/api/proxy/[...path]` and `lib/api.ts`; vitest configured; new devDeps installed.
- Plan/tracker: `docs/build/BUILD_PLAN.md`, `docs/build/MODULE_STATUS.md`, `docs/build/status/core.md`.

## 2026-09-18 — Rebuild wave 1 complete (uncommitted)

- Modules ported to FastAPI with tests written (not run): auth, forms, assessments, notices, chat. 30 endpoints under /api/v1.
- Migration 019fd8cf33f7 applied locally; alembic env guards against autogenerated drops.
- Bugs found in the original during porting: subscriber insert wrote a non-existent `source` column (silently failing); business name unescaped in notice h1/intro (kept byte-identical, flagged).
- Core fixes during integration: TimestampMixin shared-Column bug; email attachments; LLM temperature only sent when set (claude-5 family rejects it).

## 2026-09-18 — Rebuild wave 2 complete (uncommitted)

- editorial (briefings, blog, daily pipeline as worker job), outreach (contacts, crons, Resend webhook), admin (data reader, bloggers, AEO, SEO) ported with tests written, not run.
- 64 endpoints, 29 tables, 5 scheduled jobs. Migrations 0001 → 019fd8cf33f7 → c6358c0b0979.
- Compatibility kept: /api/webhooks/resend and /api/briefings/* rewritten in next.config.ts so external callers (Resend, n8n, emailed approve links) keep working.
- Guide PDFs self-hosted in frontend/public/guides/pdf/ (user decision).

## 2026-09-19 — Full test run + local Docker stack (uncommitted)

- All suites green: backend 736, vitest 243, node:test 183. `make up` equivalent: `docker compose --profile mailcatcher --profile minio up -d --wait`.
- MinIO must come from quay.io (Docker Hub image gone). package-lock must be generated by the container's npm or `npm ci` fails in the image build.

## 2026-09-19 — Rebuild wave 3 (uncommitted)

- Dead Vercel/Appwrite/Supabase-client code and packages moved/uninstalled; Terraform v2 for frontend+backend+worker on ECS with CloudFront, RDS, S3; CI builds two images.
- CloudFront supplies geo + real client IP (CloudFront-Viewer-*); ALB only reachable from CloudFront.
- Remaining: load real data (needs Supabase access), blogger-publish rule, Vercel Analytics decision; then wave 4 (tests + manual checklist) and wave 5 (user acceptance, commit).

## 2026-09-19 — Rebuild wave 4 complete (uncommitted)

- All suites green: backend 744, vitest 244, node 175; ruff, mypy strict, tsc clean. `make up` alone brings up the full local stack (db, backend, worker, frontend, mailcatcher, minio); verified from a fresh .env.example.
- passlib replaced by bcrypt (Python 3.13 removes `crypt`). Vercel Analytics only renders on Vercel.
- Next: wave 5 = user walks docs/build/MANUAL_TEST_CHECKLIST.md, then commits. Open: blogger publish rule; analytics replacement on AWS; data migration (user).

- 2026-09-19: NEXT_PUBLIC_* values are compiled at `next build` — in Docker they must be build args (NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_HINDI must be exactly "true"). Rebuild the frontend image after changing one.

- 2026-09-19: rebuild is synced to origin/main **1bea332** (3 frontend commits ported with patch, no git change). The team keeps committing to main; future syncs port `git diff 1bea332 origin/main` the same way (webapp/→frontend/, backend-bound changes rewritten in Python).

- 2026-09-19: `db/init/` moved to `backend/db/init/` (compose mount, README, compose-skeleton skill, alembic README, status/core.md updated; `db/` added to backend/.dockerignore). Existing Postgres volumes are unaffected — init scripts only run on a fresh volume.

- 2026-09-19: `backend_pre_start.py` now creates schemas ops/app + pgcrypto (idempotent) before `alembic upgrade head`, so managed Postgres without initdb (Render) migrates from empty. Deploy target discussed: frontend on Vercel, backend web + worker on Render (manual).
